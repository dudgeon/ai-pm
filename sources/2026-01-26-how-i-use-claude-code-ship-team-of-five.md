summary: "Kieran Klaassen's foundational piece on compound engineering: Claude Code is the first AI tool that feels like delegating to a colleague rather than prompting a chatbot. He covers multi-step debugging, the orchestra conductor mental model (engineer as conductor, agents as musicians), friction factor analysis, limitations (Claude going rogue on large refactors), and a concrete morning workflow. Aimed at both senior devs and junior devs who get a 'turbo boost.'"

Kieran Klaassen, the general manager of Every's AI email assistant Cora, coined the term compound engineering—the practice of using AI to make each successive feature easier to build than the last.

Key sections covered:
- Multi-step debugging like a senior engineer
- From programmer to orchestra conductor (engineer orchestrates agents, doesn't write code)
- The friction factor: why Claude Code wins for daily use over alternatives
- The limitations: Claude Code going rogue on large refactors (how to guard against it)
- For junior developers: a career turbo boost
- The real workflow: a morning with Claude Code (concrete step-by-step session)
- The final verdict

Core argument: Claude Code is qualitatively different from chat AI because it can take multi-step actions in your actual codebase, run tests, fix its own errors, and reference your full project history. The mental shift is from "prompt a chatbot" to "delegate to a colleague with context."
