New product (AI customer support in Gmail) built to 5-minute setup, auto-generates FAQs, learns company voice. Key insight: senior teams face the greatest challenge accepting AI outperforms humans in specific tasks — success requires redirecting expertise toward direction and strategy, not execution.

# How My Company Turned a Data Crisis Into an AI-native Rebirth

**The Crisis**
Stella Garber, CEO of Hoop, faced an existential threat when Slack announced it would cut off critical data access on June 30. Hoop's AI task manager relied heavily on this datastream to capture action items from Slack conversations. The company's product-market fit research showed customers found the Slack integration indispensable, threatening customer retention.

**The Pivot Strategy**
Rather than seeking workarounds, Garber's team recognized an opportunity to fundamentally rebuild as an AI-native company. They established clear guidelines for the new direction:

- Build something quickly with either large customer base or high price point
- Maintain healthy margins between AI processing costs and pricing
- Use AI for transforming unstructured data into useful outputs
- Leverage team strengths in design, storytelling, and product taste
- Target less technical audiences

**The New Product: Hoop Support Tool**
The team developed an AI-native customer support solution that:
- Works directly within Gmail without requiring new software
- Automatically generates customizable FAQs by scanning websites and inboxes
- Learns company voice and tone to match communication style
- Requires only five minutes to set up

**AI-First Development Process**
The company transformed its workflow:

1. Used ChatPRD as a thought partner for product strategy
2. Employed agentic coding tools like Claude Code to generate working prototypes
3. Ran up to 10 AI agents in parallel for accelerated development
4. Shared insights via dedicated Slack channels with regular demos

**Key Insight**
As Garber notes, integrating AI-first thinking means teams "stop doing the work and start directing it," enabling operations at vastly different scales.

**Timeline to Market**
The team achieved initial prototype, website, and ad campaign within one week, onboarding their first design partner customer the following week—a speed previously impossible.

**The Uncomfortable Truth**
Senior teams face the greatest challenge accepting that AI can outperform humans in specific tasks. Success requires maintaining humility and curiosity while redirecting expertise toward direction and strategy rather than execution.
