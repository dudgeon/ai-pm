summary: "Anjan Panneer Selvam (CPTO, Acolyte Health) on How I AI. Three workflows rethinking B2B product management through transparency and rapid prototyping: (1) Stakeholder ideas → interactive prototypes in minutes — Limitless pendant captures meeting conversation, ChatGPT refines transcript into structured prompt, Lovable generates interactive prototype (built a drag-and-drop workflow builder with React Flow); (2) Rapid market research — same refined prompt into Perplexity for competitive analysis and market sizing, output into Gamma for instant presentation-ready slides for stakeholder alignment; (3) Living product library — collection of working AI prototypes accessible to sales/CS for early customer feedback, used Rork to build a mobile prototype with selfie/facial recognition that unblocked engineering team deadlock. Core insight: cultural shift matters as much as technical — share more with sales and CEO, use prototypes to align fast and validate before building."

## Summary

How I AI episode with Anjan Panneer Selvam, CPTO of Acolyte Health. Three workflows rethinking B2B product management through radical transparency and rapid AI prototyping: (1) Stakeholder ideas → interactive prototypes in minutes — Limitless pendant captures CEO meeting conversation as transcript, ChatGPT refines raw idea into structured prompt, Lovable generates interactive prototype with suggested improvements (built a drag-and-drop workflow builder using React Flow); (2) Rapid market research and competitive analysis — same refined prompt into Perplexity for full market analysis (competitors, market size, growth opportunities), output into Gamma for clean presentation-ready slides; (3) Living product library for customer validation — collection of working prototypes accessible to sales and customer success for early feedback without any code, used Rork to build a mobile prototype with selfie/facial recognition that unblocked an engineering team deadlock by showing them the concrete vision. Core insight: the cultural shift is as important as the technical one — share more with sales and CEO, use AI prototypes to get everyone aligned quickly and validate before building.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **Limitless pendant for idea capture**: Wearable AI recorder captures stakeholder conversations as transcripts — less intrusive than meeting recorders, provides natural-language record of initial ideas
- **ChatGPT → Lovable prototype pipeline**: Refine raw meeting transcript into structured prompt, then generate interactive prototype — entire process takes minutes instead of weeks of spec writing
- **Living product library**: Open collection of AI prototypes that sales and CS can access for early customer feedback and demo purposes — scales validation without writing code
- **Prototypes unblock engineering deadlocks**: When engineering team was stuck on first mobile app, a Rork prototype with facial recognition gave them concrete ideas and unblocked the project
- **Perplexity for instant market validation**: Quick competitive analysis and market sizing from a product description prompt — proves an idea has market potential, not just that it's easy to build
- **Gamma for stakeholder presentations**: Turn AI research output into clean slides instantly — perfect for giving stakeholders a clear picture of market potential
- **Transparency over expectation management**: Share prototypes with sales early, take more ideas from the CEO — AI makes the cost of exploration so low that hiding ideas becomes counterproductive
- **Simple prompts for complex prototypes**: A single-page description like "user facing tool, map out personalized workflows" can generate a fully interactive drag-and-drop builder
