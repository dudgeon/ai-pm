summary: "Rhea Purohit challenges the prevailing efficiency framing: using AI to generate text faster produced 'flat, bland, impersonal' output. Reframe: use AI for meaning-making, not productivity. The Eiger analogy: climbers still scale mountains even though trains provide access — humans should pursue activities aligned with personal meaning, not just efficiency. Her practice: use Claude as brainstorming partner (paste drafts with blanks, request multiple options, select yourself) rather than content generator. Three steps to find your meaning-first AI approach: establish values, identify daily drivers, try more experiences."

## Raw Content

# "You're Probably Using AI Wrong" - Article Summary

## Core Argument

Author Rhea Purohit challenges the prevailing narrative that AI should maximize efficiency. Instead, she advocates reframing AI usage around **meaning-making** rather than productivity.

## Key Problem

Purohit initially tried using AI to generate text faster, expecting it to boost her writing productivity. The results disappointed her—the output was "flat, bland, and impersonal." She realized the issue wasn't AI itself, but her underlying assumptions about how it should serve her work.

## The Eiger Analogy

Purohit uses mountaineering as an illustration. Though trains now provide efficient access to Alpine peaks, climbers still scale the Eiger because they value the *experience*, not just reaching the summit. Similarly, humans should pursue activities aligned with personal meaning, not merely efficiency.

## Practical Reframing

**Her solution:** Use Claude as a brainstorming partner rather than a writer. When stuck finding examples for her essays, she pastes drafts with blanks into Claude and requests multiple options. She then selects language herself, treating the AI as ideation support rather than content generation.

## Finding Your Meaning

Purohit offers three steps:
- **Establish your values** through examining lifestyle choices
- **Identify daily drivers** by noticing when you feel most engaged
- **Try more experiences** to understand yourself better

She demonstrates using Claude conversationally to uncover that she derives meaning from research's granular details—then leveraging AI to enhance that specific workflow.
