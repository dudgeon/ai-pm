summary: "Joel Unger (Design Director, Atlassian) on How I AI. Three AI workflows for designers: (1) Prototyping interactive UI with Cursor — pasted Figma screenshot into Cursor chat, generated working resizable three-panel layout for Trello's new personal productivity features, discovered responsive edge cases impossible to find in static mockups, used Loom recordings of prototype for engineer handoff instead of written specs; (2) Recreating animated SVG logo — no source files, tight deadline, used Cursor to write SVG animation code from descriptive prompts, analyzed original GIF timing for precision; (3) Character design exploration with Midjourney — generated variations of Trello's husky mascot Taco for mood board, treating AI output as brainstorming starting point rather than final assets. Core insight: AI tools don't replace designer thinking — they free designers from tedious coding/generation to focus on creative problem-solving at a higher level."

## Summary

How I AI episode with Joel Unger, Design Director at Atlassian (Confluence, Bitbucket, Trello). Three AI workflows for designers: (1) Prototyping interactive UI with Cursor — pasted Figma screenshot into Cursor, generated working resizable three-panel layout for Trello's personal productivity features; discovered responsive edge cases impossible to find in static mockups; used Loom recordings of interactive prototype for engineer handoff instead of spec docs; feature is now live in product; (2) Recreating animated SVG logo under deadline — original After Effects files lost, 2 days before code freeze; used Cursor to generate SVG animation code from descriptive prompts, analyzed original GIF timing for precision, iterated pixel-by-pixel; (3) Character design exploration with Midjourney — generated variations of Trello mascot Taco the husky as mood board for upcoming design day, treating AI output as brainstorming starting point rather than final assets. Core insight: AI doesn't replace designer thinking — it frees designers from tedious coding to focus on creative problem-solving at a higher level.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **Figma screenshot → interactive prototype**: Paste screenshot into Cursor chat with plain English description; generates working HTML/CSS/JS prototype revealing edge cases static mockups can't show
- **Prototype as communication tool**: Record Loom of interactive prototype instead of writing spec docs — engineers instantly understand breakpoints, minimum widths, and collapse behavior
- **Emergency SVG animation without source files**: Cursor can write SVG animation code from descriptive prompts — saved a deadline when After Effects files were lost
- **AI output as mood board, not final asset**: Midjourney character variations treated as starting point for design team brainstorming, not production-ready deliverables
- **Designers expanding into engineering territory**: AI bridges the design-engineering gap — designers can now build and feel interactive experiences before production code
- **Precision requires human guidance**: AI-generated animation needed exact timing (analyzed from original GIF) and pixel-level adjustments via iterative back-and-forth
- **Prototype code ≠ production code**: Joel was clear that AI-generated prototype code lacks tests and enterprise quality — it's a communication tool, not a replacement for engineering
