summary: "Lenny Rachitsky's annual PM job market analysis using TrueUp dataset. Over 6,000 open PM roles globally — 53.6% above the 2023 bottom and up 11% YTD, the most open PM roles in over two years. Engineering roles show similar growth (scaled 10x). AI PM roles exploding: 688 open AI PM roles. Almost 1/3 of all AI-related roles globally are based in the Bay Area. Layoffs on track to be fewer than any of the past four years. Capital investment up 29% YoY and 227% over five years. Remote work declining: from 35% peak in late 2022 to 23% now, likely settling at ~20% baseline. Designer roles more stable but dipping slightly. Berlin and Austin entered top 10 PM locations; Boston and LA fell out. Emerging trend: 415 open Product Engineer roles (v0, Amplitude, n8n) — the rise of the product engineer. AI copilot tools starting to change how PMs interview."

## Summary

Lenny Rachitsky's annual deep dive into the product management job market, using TrueUp's dataset of every open role at major tech companies and top startups. Seven key findings: (1) Open PM and engineering roles are trending up — over 6,000 open PM roles globally, 53.6% above the 2023 bottom and up 11% YTD, the most in over two years. Engineering follows the same pattern, scaled 10x. (2) AI roles are exploding — 688 open AI PM roles at AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Scale), AI-driven companies (Cursor, Harvey, Lovable), and AI-specific roles at non-AI companies (e.g. AI PM at Figma). (3) Layoffs are slowing — on track for fewer layoffs than any of the past four years, though the possibility of future cuts remains. (4) Capital investment is increasing — up 29% YoY and 227% over five years (GPUs, data centers), though unclear if this translates to more jobs or just more hardware. (5) Bay Area dominance continues — nearly 20% of all PM roles, 17% of engineering, and almost a third of all AI-related roles globally are based there. Berlin and Austin entered the top 10; Boston and LA fell out. (6) Remote work is declining — from 35% at peak in late 2022 to 23% now, likely settling at a new baseline of ~20%. (7) Lots of global PM roles available — lists top 20 companies hiring PMs and top AI PM employers. Additional emerging trend: 415 open Product Engineer roles (v0, Amplitude, n8n) and growing. AI copilot tools beginning to change how PMs interview.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **PM job market recovering strongly**: Over 6,000 open PM roles globally, 53.6% above 2023 bottom, up 11% YTD — the most open PM roles in over two years
- **AI PM roles exploding**: 688 open AI PM roles across AI-native companies, AI-driven companies, and AI-specific roles at traditional tech companies
- **Bay Area as AI capital**: Almost 1/3 of all AI-related roles globally are based in the Bay Area — even more concentrated than general tech roles (~20% for PM)
- **Layoffs decelerating**: On track for fewer layoffs than any of past four years, though future cuts remain possible
- **Capital investment surging**: Up 29% YoY and 227% over five years — GPUs and data centers, unclear if it translates directly to more jobs
- **Remote work settling at new baseline**: Declined from 35% peak (late 2022) to 23% now, likely settling around 20% — trend identical across PM, engineering, and design
- **Rise of the product engineer**: 415 open Product Engineer roles (v0, Amplitude, n8n) — a new hybrid role category that appears to be growing
- **AI copilots changing PM interviews**: Anecdotal evidence that AI tools are becoming an issue in PM interviewing processes
- **Geographic shifts**: Berlin and Austin entered top 10 PM locations; Boston and LA fell out since last year's analysis
- **Designer roles more stable**: Never saw as deep a dip as PM and engineering, but showing slight recent decline
