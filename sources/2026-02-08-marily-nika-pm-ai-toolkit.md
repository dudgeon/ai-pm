summary: "Google AI PM Marily Nika demonstrates end-to-end AI workflow: Reddit research via Perplexity → PRD via custom GPT → prototype via v0.dev → video via Flow/Sora — all in ~20 minutes. Key insight: skip the PRD first, prototype first, then write the PRD. Tool-hopping between specialized AI apps beats single-platform use.

**Host:** Claire Vo
**Guest:** Marily Nika, AI Product Lead at Google

## Overview

Marily Nika demonstrates how product managers can dramatically accelerate their workflow using AI tools. She walks through a complete end-to-end process using a smart-fridge concept as an example, showing how to conduct market research, generate PRDs, create interactive prototypes, and produce stakeholder-ready video content.

## Key Workflows Covered

**Market Research via Reddit:** Using Perplexity's discussion filter to mine Reddit for authentic user insights and debates about product-market fit requirements.

**PRD Generation:** Leveraging custom GPTs that maintain personal voice and style when transforming market research into comprehensive product requirement documents.

**Interactive Prototyping:** Using v0.dev to convert PRDs into tangible prototypes that influence stakeholders during product reviews.

**Video Creation:** Employing Flow and Sora to create persuasive product demonstration videos that communicate vision more effectively than traditional presentations.

**Complete Workflow:** The entire process from research to polished video takes approximately 20 minutes.

**Specialized Tool Approach:** "Tool hopping" between specialized AI applications creates more powerful results than relying on single platforms.

**Additional Application:** NotebookLM serves as an interactive judge for product demos and pitch competitions.
