summary: "Noah Brier (Alephic AI consultancy) demonstrates using Claude Code as a research and thinking partner by pointing it at his 1,500-note Obsidian vault. Key distinction: frame as 'thinking mode' not 'writing mode' — instruct AI to ask clarifying questions before generating (too much focus on AI's ability to write, not enough on its ability to read). Vault structure: Chats, Daily Progress, Research subfolders. Research workflow: provide main points, have Claude search vault for supporting materials without making conceptual leaps. Mobile implementation via Termius + Tailscale. Agents maintain running question logs to help resume interrupted research."

# How to Use Claude Code as a Second Brain

## Overview
Noah Brier, cofounder of Alephic (an AI strategy consultancy), demonstrates using Claude Code not merely as a coding tool but as a comprehensive research and thinking partner integrated with Obsidian, a note-taking application.

## Key Setup Components

**The Foundation:** Brier runs Claude Code pointing to his Obsidian vault's root directory, granting access to approximately 1,500 notes organized across multiple folders.

**Thinking vs. Writing Mode:** He deliberately frames conversations with Claude Code as "thinking mode" rather than "writing mode," instructing the AI to ask clarifying questions before generating content. As he explains, "There's entirely too much focus on its ability to write and not enough focus on its ability to read."

## Workflow Elements

**Research Organization:** When preparing talks, Brier provides Claude Code with main points and a working title, then requests it search his vault for relevant existing research. The AI identifies supporting materials without making conceptual leaps—essentially functioning as a sophisticated search tool connecting previously researched ideas.

**Vault Structure:** The system organizes into subfolders including "Chats" (saved conversations), "Daily Progress" (tracking evolving thinking), and "Research" (articles and source materials).

**Mobile Implementation:** Using Termius (connected via Tailscale) and a basement-based computer, Brier syncs his GitHub-hosted vault to enable mobile access, allowing deep work from anywhere.

## The Agent Partner

Claude agents within Code maintain running question logs and help him resume interrupted research by summarizing recent progress, addressing what many knowledge workers struggle with: "picking it up again" after breaks.
