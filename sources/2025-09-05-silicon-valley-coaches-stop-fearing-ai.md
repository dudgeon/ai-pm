# Silicon Valley's Top Coaches Want You to Stop Fearing AI

**Main Argument:** Three prominent Silicon Valley coaches—Joe Hudson, Jonny Miller, and Steve Schlafman—argue that AI anxiety about job replacement misses a deeper opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery through intentional tool use.

## Key Insights

**Using AI for Personal Development:**

Miller recommends creating a "codex vitae"—a personal operating manual documenting your values, boundaries, and patterns. This document feeds context into AI coaching sessions, making the tool genuinely personalized rather than generic. He pairs this with scheduled 45-minute weekly AI coaching sessions for consistency and accountability.

Schlafman uses ChatGPT for Jungian dreamwork, recording daily dreams and prompting the AI to analyze them as a "Jungian analyst," then refining requests for deeper analysis and integration guidance.

**Reframing AI Anxiety:**

Hudson characterizes fear of replacement as grief rooted in identity collapse. Rather than resisting this feeling, he suggests sitting with uncertainty: "Don't rush to patch it over. Try to sit in the not-knowing because it's an invitation to discover more about who you really are." This discomfort can liberate people from restrictive professional identities.

**The Centaur Model:**

Miller references Kevin Kelly's concept of human-AI collaboration, envisioning coaching evolving into three-way dynamics: client, human coach, and AI assistant working together, with the human coach correcting AI errors and adding nuance.

**Core Principle:** Technology requires intentional, conscious application—neither inherently good nor bad, but dependent on how users choose to engage.
