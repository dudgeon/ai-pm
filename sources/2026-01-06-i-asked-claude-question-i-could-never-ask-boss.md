## Raw Content

# "I Asked Claude the Question I Could Never Ask My Boss"

## Main Premise
Katie Parrott, a staff writer at Every, used Claude and ChatGPT to analyze her work performance data—something she couldn't bring herself to believe when hearing it from human managers. The AI systems helped her recognize her professional value through data-driven analysis.

## Key Findings
Parrott discovered she was producing outsized impact relative to her output:
- 15% of Every's 2025 content output
- 25-27% of subscription trials and web views
- 18.8% of Q4 content, 29.3% of views
- Her "Working Overtime" column ran 13 points above company satisfaction averages

## Critical Insight
Parrott notes that AI made the breakthrough possible in a way human feedback couldn't: "I could say it to a chatbot because there was no social cost, and I didn't have to worry about burdening someone with my baggage."

The AI identified distinct value streams—Vibe Checks drive trials, engineering pieces attract traffic, personal essays generate reader loyalty—allowing strategic planning around different content types.

## Framework Offered
Claude presented two strategic paths forward:
1. **Conversion focus**: Emphasize tool reviews for subscriber acquisition
2. **Brand-building focus**: Expand personal column work for long-term loyalty

## Broader Lesson
Parrott concludes that anyone can build a performance case with available metrics and AI analysis—without waiting for external validation or lacking data literacy skills.
