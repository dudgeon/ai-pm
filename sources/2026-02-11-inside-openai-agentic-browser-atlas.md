summary: "OpenAI Atlas engineers Ben Goodger (head of engineering) and Darin Fisher discuss building an agentic browser: >50% of Atlas's code was written by Codex; the web won't become obsolete (people will still browse deliberately, like driving a stick shift vs Waymo); browsers should balance being invisible (agent does the work) vs being a guide (showing you around). Key insight: AI coding tools are better at finding elegant solutions than humans, and produce better-tested codebases as a side effect."

By Rhea Purohit (article) / Hosted by Dan Shipper | February 11, 2026 | AI & I Podcast

Dan Shipper sits down with two members of the team building OpenAI's agentic browser Atlas: Ben Goodger, head of engineering, and Darin Fisher, member of technical staff.

These "computer errands"—downloading a W-2 when tax season rolls around, hunting for the right coupon code before checkout—are exactly what Atlas, OpenAI's agentic browser, aims to handle. More than half the code behind Atlas was written by Codex, OpenAI's coding agent.

**How browsing the web will evolve**

As agentic browsers become mainstream, they raise fundamental questions about the future of the web, and human experience on it.

**The web will survive—with less drudgery**

One of the big questions hanging over agentic browsers is whether they eventually make the web obsolete. Goodger doesn't buy that future. Yes, people will increasingly hand off tedious or mechanical work to agents, but there are parts of the web people will still want to experience directly.

Fisher offered an analogy: He loves taking Waymos, but he also loves driving his stick shift. Sometimes you want to be chauffeured; sometimes you want to be in control. The same will be true for browsing.

**A browser as a guide, not just a doorway**

For most of the web's history, browsers have been an empty door frame between you and whatever site you're visiting. Goodger argues Atlas is built to balance this duality. The interface is deliberately minimal, keeping the focus on the content you're viewing—but it's also designed to be an active guide when you need it.

**An inside look at building an agentic browser**

Goodger estimates that more than half the code behind Atlas was written by Codex, OpenAI's coding agent. Goodger and Fisher have been manually coding browsers together for decades, and they both say that building with AI is transformatively different—not just faster, but qualitatively different.

For Fisher, the value lies in navigating complexity. For years they've worked in the Chromium codebase, which is enormous. AI coding tools help navigate that complexity in ways that weren't possible before.

Goodger sees a similar division of labor. AI coding tools are often surprisingly good at finding elegant solutions that a human might not think of—because the AI isn't burdened by the same cognitive habits. Another upshot of coding with AI is that the Atlas codebase is better-tested than it otherwise would be.
