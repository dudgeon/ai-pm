# Build Places, Not Products: Article Summary

## Main Thesis
Lucas Crespo argues that software design should prioritize creating inviting digital environments rather than merely functional products. The distinction between design and art direction is crucial—while design solves interaction problems, art direction shapes the overall atmosphere and feel that makes users want to inhabit a space.

## Key Arguments

**The Problem of Sameness**
Design systems and utility frameworks like Tailwind have democratized good design but inadvertently created homogeneity. As Crespo observes, when AI generates interfaces using median statistical patterns, "the web accelerates toward a single, hyper-optimized, bloodless template." This convergence means differentiation becomes a valuable competitive advantage.

**Case Study: Cora Email Assistant**
Every's email product exemplifies this philosophy. Rather than adopting sterile dashboards, the team chose oil-painted sky backgrounds—deliberately violating conventional performance best practices. This required engineering solutions to handle massive image files, but the artistic choice created emotional resonance that flat designs cannot match.

**Art Direction as Architecture**
Crespo reframes art direction as a structural discipline operating above graphic design. It establishes a "visual north star" ensuring every element—from typography to imagery—communicates coherent emotional intent.

## Core Insight
When products solve similar problems equally well, the experience that "feels better to use" wins. Subtle atmospheric choices compound into meaningful differentiation in an increasingly commodified software landscape.
