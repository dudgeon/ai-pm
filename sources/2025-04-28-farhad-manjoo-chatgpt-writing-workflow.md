summary: "Farhad Manjoo (fmr NYT columnist) on How I AI. Three AI-enhanced writing workflows: (1) AI research assistant — turns half-day research grind into minutes using ChatGPT web search for broad questions, synthesis, and source verification; (2) 'Super thesaurus' — provides context-aware word and idiom suggestions categorized by tone (dramatic, colloquial, formal, ironic), tests word fit in context; (3) Always-on first reader — paste sections during writing for instant structural feedback on clarity, flow, and thesis strength. AI described as '80% as smart' as a human research assistant but instant, always available, and never minds dumb questions. Key insight: AI enhances the creative process rather than replacing it — speeds up tedious parts (research) and sharpens creative parts (language, structure)."

## Summary

How I AI episode with Farhad Manjoo, former New York Times columnist. Initially skeptical of AI in creative writing, Farhad now has ChatGPT open alongside his document for every piece. Three detailed workflows: (1) AI research assistant — start with broad conceptual questions, get synthesized summaries with direct source links, interrogate results conversationally to find new angles; replaces half-day research grind; (2) "Super thesaurus" — provide full sentence context, specify creative direction, get categorized alternatives by tone (dramatic, colloquial, formal, ironic), test word fit in context; replaced common idiom "pay the piper" with "the devil came to collect"; (3) Always-on first reader — paste sections mid-writing for structural feedback on clarity, flow, and thesis; not for rewriting but for critique. Farhad describes AI as "maybe 80% as smart" as his former human research assistant at the Times, but instant, always available, and willing to answer any question. Core insight: AI enhances the creative process by speeding up tedious parts (research) and sharpening creative parts (language, structure), freeing writers to focus on core ideas and voice.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **AI as research assistant, not replacement**: Turns half-day research grind into minutes — broad conceptual questions → synthesized summaries with source links → conversational deep-dives into specific angles
- **"Super thesaurus" technique**: Provide full sentence context + creative direction to get categorized word suggestions (dramatic, colloquial, formal, ironic) that a standard thesaurus would never produce
- **Test word fit in context**: Ask AI to validate whether a specific word works in your sentence — it explains semantic nuances and suggests alternatives if the fit is wrong
- **Always-on first reader**: Paste sections during writing for instant structural feedback — checks for buried lede, unclear thesis, and flow issues without rewriting
- **AI as "80% as smart" human assistant**: Instant, always available, never minds dumb questions — the accessibility and patience matter as much as the intelligence
- **Skeptic-to-adopter journey**: Professional writers who initially resisted AI can find it genuinely enhances craft when used as a creative companion rather than content generator
- **Source verification built into workflow**: Web-enabled AI provides direct links to sources, enabling journalists to click through and verify original context — critical for trust
- **Creative direction in prompts matters**: Don't just ask for synonyms — give the AI creative direction ("catchier," "metaphorical," "fresh") to get genuinely useful suggestions
