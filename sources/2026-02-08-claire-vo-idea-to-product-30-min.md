## Overview

This episode features Claire Vo, Chief Product Officer at LaunchDarkly and founder of ChatPRD, demonstrating how AI agents can accelerate product development cycles. The discussion covers practical workflows for building features rapidly using AI tools.

## Key Topics Covered

**Building Features with AI Agents**

Claire demonstrates creating a feedback categorization feature for ChatPRD. The workflow involves using ChatPRD to generate product requirements documentation, then delegating implementation to Devin, an AI coding agent. She emphasizes a critical technique: "Write me a PRD I can send to my engineering team" helps AI tailor content appropriately.

**Tool Preferences**

Claire has replaced most of her Cursor usage with Devin, citing the asynchronous workflow advantage. She can delegate tasks while away from her desk — like fixing bugs during morning walks — and receive Slack notifications when work completes.

**Product Management Evolution**

The episode discusses how traditional PM roles are transforming in an AI-driven landscape. Claire advises product leaders to adapt their skill sets to remain relevant over the next 18 months, focusing on three future-proof competencies for PM careers.

**Additional Discussion Points**

The conversation explores balancing her CPO responsibilities with side projects and family commitments, and addresses the emerging trend of multiplayer AI agents.
