**What the Team Behind Cursor Knows About the Future of Code**

By Katie Parrott | January 22, 2026 | Source Code

Based on Every's Cursor Camp with Cursor developer education lead Lee Robinson.

Key takeaways:
- **The death of the IDE**: IDEs are being replaced by AI-native editors; the code editor is just a thin layer now
- **A browser built from scratch by AI (for $80,000)**: Cursor's team rebuilt a Next.js app browser from scratch using AI — took weeks and ~$80k in compute
- **How a Cursor coder uses Cursor**: Planning comes first; model selection is vibes-based (no systematic approach); review is baked into every session
- **Retrieval over compression**: Better to retrieve full context when needed than to compress context aggressively
- **Q&A highlights**: Questions to ask before switching to Cursor from other tools

Note: Article is based on a sponsored event — Cursor provided $100 in credits to attendees.
