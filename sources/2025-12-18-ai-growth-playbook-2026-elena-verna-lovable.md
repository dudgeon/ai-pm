# The New AI Growth Playbook for 2026 | Elena Verna (Lovable)

## Summary

Lenny's Podcast (4th appearance) with Elena Verna, Head of Growth at Lovable, the leading AI-powered app builder that hit $200M ARR in under a year with just 100 employees. Elena's core argument: 60-70% of traditional growth tactics no longer apply. The growth playbook has been fundamentally rewritten for AI companies. You must re-find product-market fit every 3 months because underlying technology and customer expectations change so fast. At Lovable, optimization drives only ~5% of growth — the other 95% comes from launching new features and products. Key growth tactics: give product away as marketing (fund hackathons, sponsor events, hand out free credits — treat as marketing spend, not cost), influencer marketing outperforms paid ads by 10x (short videos showing what the product can do), and ship constantly while talking about it publicly (engineers announce own updates, founder tweets daily). "Minimum viable product" is dead — the new bar is "minimum lovable product" because if the experience doesn't delight, nobody tells anyone. Community (Discord with hundreds of thousands of members) is infrastructure, not nice-to-have — it amplifies word of mouth, drives retention, and creates insider feeling. Hire high-agency people who create clarity from chaos: AI-native new graduates and former founders who operate without instructions.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **Re-find PMF every 3 months**: AI technology changes so fast that product-market fit is a treadmill — even at $200M ARR, you're constantly re-earning it
- **95% new features, 5% optimization**: Small funnel tweaks don't move the needle when everything is changing — growth comes from launching new capabilities
- **Give product away as growth strategy**: Free credits, hackathons, and events treated as marketing spend, not cost — compounds through word of mouth and outperforms paid acquisition
- **Influencer marketing > paid ads by 10x**: Short videos showing what the product can do spread faster and convert better than traditional advertising; showing beats telling
- **Minimum lovable product replaces MVP**: If the experience doesn't delight, nobody tells anyone — word of mouth is the primary engine, so delight is table stakes
- **Community as infrastructure**: Lovable's Discord (hundreds of thousands of members) amplifies word of mouth, drives retention, and creates insider feeling — not a nice-to-have
- **Ship constantly and narrate publicly**: Engineers announce their own updates, founder tweets progress daily — keeps users curious and competitors scrambling
- **Hire for chaos tolerance**: High-agency people who thrive in mess, AI-native new grads, and former founders who operate without instructions
- **60-70% of old growth playbook is obsolete**: Elena has led growth at Miro, Dropbox, Amplitude — says only 30-40% of her 20 years of learning still applies
- **Work-life balance is possible at hypergrowth**: Elena protects gym and family hours, refuses to treat burnout as badge of honor — work fills available time, not all time
