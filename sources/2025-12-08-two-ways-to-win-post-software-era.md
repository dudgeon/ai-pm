summary: "Sumeet Singh applies Sutton's 'bitter lesson' (simple systems + scale beat specialized solutions) to argue that most AI SaaS wrappers will be absorbed as base models improve — the task-length models can handle is doubling every 7 months, making specialized tools obsolete in ~18 months. Two viable paths: (1) The Model Economy — infrastructure models need (compute exchanges, on-device AI, data exchanges, offensive security); (2) Post-skeuomorphic apps — workflows impossible without AI (multi-agent coordination, simulations at scale, self-healing software). Critical question: is this company in line to be absorbed by the bitter lesson?"

# Two Ways to Win in the Post-software Era

**Author:** Sumeet Singh | **Publication:** Every | **Date:** December 8, 2025

## Core Argument

Singh contends that most AI founders are making a critical strategic error by building specialist tools atop foundation models using outdated SaaS frameworks. He references Richard Sutton's "bitter lesson"—the principle that simple systems with massive scale and compute consistently outperform specialized, hand-crafted solutions.

## The Central Problem

"The length of tasks generalist models can achieve is doubling every seven months," Singh notes, making specialized AI wrappers vulnerable to obsolescence within 18 months as base models grow more capable.

## Two Viable Paths Forward

### Path 1: The Model Economy
Companies building infrastructure that models require to improve, rather than applications using current models:

- **Compute as commodity**: Trading compute resources and energy via exchanges like San Francisco Compute Company
- **On-device AI**: Hardware-software combinations enabling local model deployment (examples: Meta wearables, Truffle)
- **Data exchanges**: Facilitating licensing of specialized data to model providers
- **Security**: Offensive security services identifying AI system vulnerabilities

### Path 2: Post-Skeuomorphic Apps
Applications discovering entirely new workflows impossible without AI—avoiding the trap of digitizing old processes:

- **Multi-agent coordination**: Using multiple models simultaneously to eliminate individual model limitations
- **Simulations at scale**: Running thousands of parallel experiments with continuous feedback
- **Continuous feedback loops**: Self-healing software that autonomously diagnoses and fixes problems without human intervention

## The Critical Question

"Is this company in line to be absorbed by the bitter lesson, or can it thrive by building for scale or true novelty?"
