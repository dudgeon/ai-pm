summary: "Wade Foster (CEO, Zapier) presents three interconnected AI workflows for recruiting and culture: (1) Extract 'unspoken company culture' from meeting transcripts via Granola's Recipe feature, then transform into hiring rubrics with ChatGPT. (2) Build Zapier Agent triggered by Granola interview notes — evaluates candidates against job description + values rubric, emails structured YES/NO/MAYBE recommendation. Enhanced live with Copilot to add interviewer feedback and subject-line decisions. (3) Source 'diamonds in the rough' talent via Grok's real-time X access — iterative prompting to find passionate creators outside traditional LinkedIn channels. Anti-'delegation trap': leaders must be in the trenches with AI, not just write memos."

# Zapier CEO's Playbook for AI-Powered Recruiting and Culture Building

## Summary

Three interconnected workflows forming an end-to-end AI recruiting playbook. **Workflow 1 (Culture Extraction)**: Granola records all meetings, creating massive transcript corpus. Built-in "Recipes" feature runs "Build the unspoken company culture handbook" prompt across transcripts — reveals how the org actually operates vs. stated values. Output fed into ChatGPT to generate interview scoring rubrics. **Workflow 2 (Interview Agent)**: Zapier Agent triggers when new Granola notes appear in "New Interviews" folder. Agent evaluates candidate against uploaded Job Description + Values Rubric knowledge sources, provides YES/NO/MAYBE with 3-5 sentence reasoning, emails result. Enhanced live during recording with Copilot to add interviewer self-feedback and decision in email subject line. **Workflow 3 (Talent Sourcing with Grok)**: Iterative prompting to find under-the-radar creators on X — modest followings, tutorial creators, real profiles (not bots), outside Bay Area for budget. Also pivots to YouTube. Surfaces candidates and geographic talent hotspots invisible to traditional recruiting.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **"Delegation trap" anti-pattern**: Leaders who write AI memos then step back aren't leading AI adoption — you must be in the trenches doing hackathons, show-and-tells, and hands-on experimentation
- **Ambient meeting data → cultural artifacts**: Meeting transcripts capture actual behaviors and decision-making patterns that formal values documents miss — AI can analyze these at scale
- **Culture rubric pipeline**: Unstructured meetings → AI cultural analysis → hiring rubrics → automated interview evaluation — each output feeds the next
- **Zapier Agents with knowledge sources**: Upload Google Docs (job descriptions, values rubrics) as context; agent grounds evaluation in specific documents rather than general knowledge
- **Evaluate the interviewer, not just the candidate**: Adding self-assessment for the interviewer against the rubric catches gaps in interview coverage
- **Grok's unique advantage for social sourcing**: Real-time X access surfaces talent that LinkedIn and traditional ATS can't find — particularly valuable for roles requiring internet-native skills
- **Iterative refinement for talent sourcing**: Refine results by filtering bots, requiring real photos, specifying geography, pivoting to other platforms (YouTube)
- **"Don't be a robot, build a robot"**: Zapier core value that embodies the approach — automate what you can, focus human energy on what matters
