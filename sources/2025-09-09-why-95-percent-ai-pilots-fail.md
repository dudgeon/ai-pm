summary: "Marc Malott (ex-300-person consulting firm) explains the counterintuitive failure mode: when AI pilots succeed, leadership raises targets and prices to capture ROI immediately — this destroys slack for innovation and paradoxically impedes further progress. The root cause: 'companies so eager to make their money back that they are sacrificing long-term payoff.' MIT study: 95% of corporate generative AI pilots fail; McKinsey: 80%+ of executives say AI hasn't moved enterprise earnings. Lesson: harvesting immediate returns eliminates compounding value creation."

# Why 95 Percent of AI Pilots Fail—And How to Avoid It

## Key Argument

Marc Malott argues that companies pursuing AI transformation sacrifice long-term value by chasing short-term ROI, creating systemic failures that affect nearly every legacy business attempting digital adaptation.

## The Problem

A MIT study found that 95% of corporate generative AI pilots are failing. McKinsey reports that over 80% of executives say AI hasn't moved enterprise earnings tangibly. The author witnessed this firsthand at a 300-person consulting firm where early success became a trap.

## How Success Triggers Failure

The firm successfully implemented an AI tool for research call analysis, unlocking 40,000 human hours and delighting clients. Rather than investing these gains into further innovation, leadership raised hourly rates and performance targets to capture ROI immediately.

The consequences were counterintuitive: "After we raised performance targets and hourly prices, progress became exponentially more difficult." Slack for innovation disappeared. Decision timelines slowed. A critical product rollout stalled for nearly a year as overwhelmed teams focused solely on hitting new numbers.

## Root Cause

Companies are "so eager to make their money back that they are sacrificing long-term payoff." This pressure creates friction that paradoxically impedes progress and prevents compounding value creation.

## The Solution (Implied)

Rather than harvesting immediate returns, organizations should build environments where sustained innovation and compounding value become natural byproducts of the system itself.
