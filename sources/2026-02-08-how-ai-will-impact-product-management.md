summary: "Argues that AI will most disrupt high-level strategic PM skills (strategy, vision, discovery — rated 🤖🤖🤖🤖), not soft skills. Organizes PM work into three jobs: Shape the Product, Ship the Product, Sync the People. Rates each sub-skill on a 1-5 AI disruption scale. Already cited heavily in lifecycle-framework-v2."

# How AI Will Impact Product Management

**Author:** Lenny Rachitsky
**Date Published:** April 9, 2024

## Overview

Rachitsky challenges conventional wisdom about which PM skills AI will disrupt, arguing that the opposite of popular belief is true. He contends that AI will most significantly impact high-level strategic work — areas historically considered most valuable — while soft skills will become increasingly differentiated.

## Key Argument

Rachitsky posits that "AI will have the most profound impact on the high-level...skills of product management: developing a strategy, crafting a vision, identifying new opportunities."

Meanwhile, capabilities like stakeholder alignment, creativity, and team collaboration will remain distinctly human domains where competitive advantage lies.

## Framework: Three PM Jobs

The article organizes PM work into three categories, rating AI impact from 1-5 🤖:

**1. Shape the Product (🤖🤖🤖)**
- Strategy & vision (🤖🤖🤖🤖): "AI tooling will become increasingly smart at suggesting goals"
- Goal-setting (🤖🤖🤖🤖)
- Specs creation (🤖🤖🤖)
- Discovery (🤖🤖🤖)
- Roadmapping (🤖🤖)
- Design feedback (🤖🤖)

**2. Ship the Product (🤖🤖)**
Content discussing execution and delivery.

**3. Sync the People**
The PM function least disrupted by AI — stakeholder alignment, team coordination, organizational influence.

## Supporting Examples

Rachitsky references AlphaGo's Move 37 against Lee Sedol as precedent for AI discovering novel strategic approaches humans hadn't considered across millennia.

He also cites tech leaders: Sam Altman suggesting AI will determine business returns, and Jensen Huang noting AI will eliminate programming requirements.

## Actionable Takeaway

Rather than abandoning strategic thinking, PMs should leverage AI as a tool while doubling down on distinctly human strengths: influence, nuanced judgment, and team orchestration.

"High-level strategic skills will be most disrupted by AI, while soft skills become more valuable."
