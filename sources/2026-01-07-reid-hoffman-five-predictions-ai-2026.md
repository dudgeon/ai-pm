summary: "Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn cofounder, VC) predicts 2026 will be 'the year we move from agentic coding to agents in everything else' — the coding frontier matters because the capabilities (planning, parallel execution, orchestration) generalize to all knowledge work. Predicts enterprise meetings will be routinely recorded and summarized by agents; practical AGI = individuals directing agent teams; biology as the next AI language (treating biological systems as a language to model)."

# Reid Hoffman's Five AI Predictions for 2026

Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn cofounder and venture capitalist, shared five predictions about artificial intelligence's trajectory in 2026 during a podcast interview.

## Key Predictions

**Coding Agents as Foundation**
Hoffman views coding as the frontier where AI labs must excel, as the underlying capabilities—planning, parallel execution, and task orchestration—form the basis for AI tools across all knowledge work domains.

**Agents Breaking Beyond Coding**
While 2025 saw significant advances in agentic coding (tools like Claude Code), Hoffman predicts 2026 will be "the year we move from agentic coding to agents in everything else." He anticipates exponentially more people will experience AI completing productive work while they step away.

**Crowded Competitive Landscape**
The coding agent race resembles a "horse race" with OpenAI and Anthropic trading leads. Hoffman credits Anthropic's efficiency and notes that smaller players like Replit and Lovable could produce surprises, while late entrants like Apple face increasing disadvantages.

**Enterprise AI Adoption**
By 2026's end, thriving companies will record meetings and deploy agents to identify action items and prepare briefings. Companies neglecting this risk obsolescence comparable to "horses and buggies" versus automobiles.

**AGI Redefined**
Rather than sci-fi scenarios, Hoffman envisions practical AGI as individual workers directing agent teams, effectively multiplying their capacity. This capability will expand beyond coding into broader domains.

**Biology as AI's Next Language**
Hoffman highlights biology as an underappreciated frontier, treating biological systems as a "language" to model molecules and generate new scientific hypotheses.

## Broader Context

Hoffman acknowledges that despite AI's empowering potential, public discourse may grow more negative as the technology becomes a scapegoat for social disruption, even as individual capabilities expand.
