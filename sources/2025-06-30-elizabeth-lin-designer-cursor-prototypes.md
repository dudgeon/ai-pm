summary: "Elizabeth Lin (independent design educator, Design is a Party) on How I AI. Three workflows showing designers how to use Cursor as a creative partner: (1) Visual style exploration — ask Cursor to list design aesthetics with descriptive keywords, then combine styles (Brutalist + Y2K) to generate unexpected variations; use restore checkpoint to try the same prompt multiple times for different creative outputs; (2) Interactive piano prototype — custom Cursor Rule automates project setup, then a single prompt generates a fully functional digital piano with sound in Old Mac OS style (HTML/CSS/JS); (3) Teaching AI 'good taste' — refine an ugly AI-generated dashboard using three-angle feedback: negative feedback (remove drop shadows), aesthetic direction (make modern), positive examples (look like Robinhood/Stripe); apply Edward Tufte data viz principles; use psychological hack prompts ('make it look like Apple would approve'). Core insight: designers shouldn't fear code-based AI tools — Cursor is becoming a creative partner, not just a code assistant."

## Summary

How I AI episode with Elizabeth Lin, independent design educator who runs "Design is a Party" and teaches courses like "Prototyping with Cursor." Three workflows showing designers how to use Cursor as a creative partner beyond coding: (1) Visual style exploration as AI mood board — ask Cursor to list design aesthetics with descriptive keywords (Cyberpunk: neon schemes, glitch effects), then combine unlikely styles (Brutalist + Y2K) to generate unexpected creative variations; use restore checkpoint feature to try the same prompt multiple times for entirely different outputs; (2) Interactive piano prototype with sound — custom Cursor Rule automates project setup ("copy this folder and add to homepage"), then a single prompt generates a fully functional digital piano with sound in Old Mac OS style, complete with HTML/CSS/JS and clickable keys that play notes; (3) Teaching AI "good taste" for UI refinement — take an ugly AI-generated finance dashboard and refine it using three-angle feedback: negative feedback (explicitly remove drop shadows), aesthetic direction (make modern), and positive examples (reference Robinhood, Cash App, Stripe); then apply Edward Tufte data visualization principles as a design shortcut; use psychological hack prompts like "make it look like something a top Apple designer would approve." Also previewed a Notion-powered bookshelf app showing prototyping with real data.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **Cursor as creative partner for designers**: Not just a code editor — use it for brainstorming visual aesthetics, building interactive prototypes with sound, and iteratively refining UI designs
- **Same prompt, different results**: Run the exact same style prompt multiple times with checkpoint restores to get entirely unique creative variations — treat prompts as creative levers
- **Single-prompt interactive prototypes**: A fully functional piano with sound generated from one prompt — capabilities that would take hours in Figma and are impossible without code
- **Cursor Rules for workflow automation**: Define simple rules like "copy this folder and add to homepage" to eliminate repetitive setup tasks
- **Three-angle design feedback**: Negative feedback (remove what you hate) + aesthetic direction (high-level descriptors) + positive examples (reference well-designed products) — much more effective than "make it better"
- **Design theory as prompting shortcut**: Reference established design thinkers (Edward Tufte) and the AI already knows the principles — no need to spell out every detail
- **Psychological hack prompts**: "Make it look like something Apple would approve" taps into the AI's knowledge of Apple's design philosophy for instant quality improvement
- **Prototyping with real data**: Connecting to a Notion database for a bookshelf app demonstrates next-level prototyping that goes beyond static mockups
