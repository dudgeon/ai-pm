summary: "Mike Taylor (co-author O'Reilly prompt engineering book) argues DSPy, an automated prompt optimization framework, has superseded manual prompt writing for most use cases. Taylor uses it for client work and delivers better results. DSPy is 'severely underhyped' (Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke). Core argument: 'I can still beat DSPy if I try hard enough, but for anyone without five years of prompt engineering experience, you're better off relying on DSPy.' The tool democratizes prompt quality, making expertise less individually dependent and more systematically reproducible."

# Article Summary: "I've Stopped Writing Prompts—DSPy Does It Better"

## Main Argument
Mike Taylor, an AI engineer and prompt engineering expert, argues that DSPy—an automated prompt optimization framework—has made manual prompt writing obsolete for most use cases. Rather than viewing this as a threat to his profession, he's adopted the tool and now delivers better results to clients.

## Key Points

**What is DSPy?**
DSPy is an automated prompt-optimization tool that systematically improves prompt quality and reliability without requiring manual tweaking. It represents a shift from craft-based prompt engineering to systematic optimization.

**Taylor's Professional Evolution**
Taylor has worked with language models since OpenAI's GPT-3 beta (2020), including applications in fraud detection and advertising. He authored a book on prompt engineering but now relies primarily on DSPy for client work.

**Industry Recognition**
Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke recently called DSPy "severely underhyped," and industry observers have declared "prompt engineering is dead"—though Taylor frames this as evolution rather than obsolescence.

## Core Argument
"I can still beat DSPy if I try hard enough, but for anyone with the time and my five years of prompt engineering experience, you're better off relying on DSPy."

This suggests the tool democratizes prompt quality, making expertise less individually dependent and more systematically reproducible.
