summary: "Zach Leach (Head of Design, Gamma) on How I AI. Three workflows for a lean 30-person team serving a 60% international user base: (1) Multilingual feedback analysis — upload 550 responses to ChatGPT Deep Research, get translated/categorized product analysis in 19 minutes, paste into Gamma for instant presentation with charts; (2) Scalable art direction — Midjourney with brand Style References (--sref) as an on-demand art department, rapid creative iteration through happy accidents, Replicate for background removal polish; (3) Standardized job descriptions — Claude Projects with few-shot examples of best existing JDs, any hiring manager generates on-brand postings with simple prompts. Core insight: AI as personal data researcher, art department, and hiring coordinator frees designers to focus on craft and delight."

## Summary

How I AI episode with Zach Leach, Head of Design at Gamma (AI-native presentation tool, ~30 person team, 60% international users). Three workflows showing how a small team uses AI to operate at global scale: (1) Multilingual feedback analysis — exported 550 user responses about AI image editor feature, uploaded to ChatGPT Deep Research with product-focused prompt, got comprehensive translated/categorized analysis in 19 minutes (vs. cherry-picking 20 English responses before), pasted output directly into Gamma for instant shareable presentation with charts that drove real roadmap decisions; (2) Scalable art direction with Midjourney — created brand "kit" using Style References (--sref) so anyone can generate on-brand images, rapid creative iteration following intuition through happy accidents (random bird → final concept), final polish with Replicate for high-quality background removal → Figma; (3) Standardized job descriptions with Claude Projects — uploaded best existing JDs as few-shot examples, any hiring manager generates on-brand postings with simple prompts, paste into Gamma template for instant careers page. Core insight: AI as personal data researcher, art department, and hiring coordinator frees the design team to focus on craft, detail, and delight.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **ChatGPT Deep Research for feedback at scale**: Upload hundreds of multilingual responses, get a product-focused analysis that translates, categorizes, and surfaces themes — 19 minutes vs. the old approach of cherry-picking a few English responses
- **Prompt specificity matters**: Basic ChatGPT prompt just wrote a Python keyword-matching script; specifying Deep Research and giving a detailed product-focused prompt got genuinely insightful nuanced analysis
- **Midjourney Style References as brand kit**: Use --sref to create reusable brand styles so anyone at the company can generate on-brand images without design expertise
- **Follow creative intuition with zero friction**: Rapid iteration through hundreds of variations in Midjourney — happy accidents (random bird in an apple image) spark new creative directions that would take weeks with traditional agencies
- **Replicate for final polish**: ML models for specific tasks like high-quality background removal — seconds vs. manual pen tool tracing, adds that extra layer of craft
- **Claude Projects for organizational consistency**: Few-shot prompting with best existing examples lets any hiring manager generate on-brand job descriptions — saves time, reinforces quality, and is reusable team-wide
- **Feedback → presentation pipeline**: ChatGPT analysis → Gamma auto-generates presentation with charts → immediate basis for product/engineering roadmap conversations
- **AI enables lean teams at global scale**: 30-person team serving international users without sacrificing quality on research, brand, or hiring
