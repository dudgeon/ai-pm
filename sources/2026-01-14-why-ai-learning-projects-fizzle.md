summary: "Nir Zicherman (CEO of AI learning platform Oboe) argues that LLMs make it easy to go deep on topics but don't solve the core learning problem: retention, spaced repetition, and building durable mental models. General-purpose LLMs optimize for answering questions, not for making knowledge stick. Real learning requires structured practice, testing yourself, and a system that spaces repetition — things general-purpose chat AI actively resists doing."

**Why Your AI Learning Projects Keep Fizzling Out**
*Founder Nir Zicherman on what general-purpose LLMs can't do—and what real learning requires*

By Rhea Purohit (article) / Hosted by Dan Shipper | January 14, 2026 | AI & I Podcast

Dan Shipper sits down with Nir Zicherman, CEO and cofounder of AI learning platform Oboe, to talk about how to use LLMs to teach yourself anything — and why they mostly fail at it.

Key theme: What LLMs have taught Zicherman about learning — LLMs are optimized for answering questions, not building durable knowledge. Real learning requires spaced repetition, retrieval practice, and structured feedback loops that general-purpose chat AI resists.
