summary: "Chris Silvestri distinguishes prompt engineering (narrow instructions) from context engineering (supplying rich foundational materials: customer interviews, brand voice guides, competitive analysis, strategic goals). Context engineering creates a 'data-informed world' for AI to operate within, producing strategically resonant rather than technically correct output. Side-by-side demo in Gemini shows identical prompts yield different outputs when context has accumulated from prior conversations. Core philosophy: scaling production without scaling human judgment is a recipe for disaster — judgment is where the heavy lifting happens."

# How to Make AI Write Less Like AI

## Core Argument

Chris Silvestri argues that AI-generated writing has become technically correct but strategically hollow. The solution isn't better prompts—it's providing AI with rich context before asking it to write.

## Key Distinction: Prompt vs. Context Engineering

**Prompt Engineering** gives AI narrow instructions: "Write headlines for VPs of finance. Tone: confident but not arrogant."

**Context Engineering** supplies foundational materials first: customer interview transcripts, brand voice guides, competitive analysis, and strategic goals. This creates a data-informed world for AI to operate within.

## The Three-Phase Workflow

The article references a system with distinct phases. Silvestri demonstrates through side-by-side examples in Gemini how identical prompts produce different outputs when one chat has accumulated context from earlier conversations.

## The Author's Philosophy

Silvestri draws from his own failure in 2015 when outsourced blog posts were rejected as "crap." This forced him to learn writing fundamentals methodically. He applies that lesson to AI: "Scaling production without scaling human judgment is a recipe for disaster."

The critical insight: judgment—human editorial choices—is where the heavy lifting happens, transforming technically sound prose into strategically resonant work.
