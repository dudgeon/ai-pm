# Claude Code: The Most Common Questions Beginners Ask

## Article Summary

This article compiles 23 frequently asked questions from 200 beginners who participated in Every's inaugural Claude Code for Beginners cohort. The piece addresses setup, installation, subscription requirements, and conceptual understanding of Claude Code.

## Key Content

### Setup and Installation

**Windows Compatibility:**
Claude Code functions on Windows using PowerShell or Command Prompt. Installation requires specific commands for each terminal type.

**Terminal Applications:**
Most users should start with native terminal apps (Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows). Advanced alternatives like Warp or VS Code are optional upgrades, not requirements.

**Subscription Requirements:**
"Claude Code requires either a Claude Pro or Claude Max subscription. The free tier doesn't include access to Claude Code."

**MCP (Model Context Protocol):**
These are optional extensions connecting Claude Code to external tools. Playwright MCP is identified as the most essential for browser automation and testing.

**Permissions Mode:**
Users can run Claude Code in bypass permissions mode (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) for smoother operation when comfortable with autonomous AI work. Permission mode is recommended for sensitive data or unfamiliar code.

### Key Distinction

The article indicates that understanding trust and mindset matters as much as technical setup—beginners need confidence collaborating with autonomous AI tools.

The "apartment vs. hotel" metaphor: The cloud app is like a hotel room (clean, set up for you, fresh start each time). Claude Code is like your own apartment with AI — persistent, customized, no artificial constraints.
