summary: "Eleanor Warnock (Every's managing editor) argues that AI-generated content floods make 'writing-first practitioners' (Fred Wilson, Julie Zhuo, Warren Buffett — those who write to think, not just to market) more valuable, not less. Their authentic voice, cultivated networks, and reasoning-in-public can't be prompted into existence. AI sharpens their edge by letting them produce more while non-writers just produce noise. Practical maps: where this archetype creates leverage, tech stack for writing-first practitioners."

**The Heyday of the Writing-first Practitioner**

By Eleanor Warnock | January 8, 2026

AI makes content generation trivial — so does prolific public writing lose its advantage? Warnock argues the opposite: writing-first practitioners (people who write to think, not just to market) gain a sharper edge in a world flooded with AI text. Their cultivated voice and hard-won networks can't be prompted into existence.

Key sections:
- **Where writing creates disproportionate leverage**: Building reputation, trust, and network that compounds
- **Why AI sharpens the edge**: Writing-first practitioners can produce more; non-writers just produce noise
- **The catch: You can't fake it**: Authentic reasoning-in-public requires actually having reasoning worth publishing
- **Why you should hire writing-first practitioners**: They think clearly, communicate precisely, learn faster
- **The tech stack for writing-first practitioners**: Tools that amplify the writing loop
- **The archetype endures**: In an AI world, authentic voice is more scarce, not less
