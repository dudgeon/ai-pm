summary: "Dan Shipper argues that business 'principles' are context-dependent patterns that fail unpredictably, not universal laws. Five reasons business defies scientific laws: equifinality/multifinality (same approach, different outcomes — Apple retail worked, JC Penney failed), impossible experimentation (no A/B testing of major strategic decisions), sensitive dependence (timing butterfly effects), hidden exceptions, and creative subjectivity. 'Business principles are usually anecdotes presented as axioms.' Path forward: develop gut-level pattern recognition (how language models work) rather than memorizing rules."

# Article Summary: "Seeing Business Like a Language Model"

## Main Thesis
Dan Shipper argues that business "principles" function differently than scientific laws. Rather than universal rules, they're context-dependent patterns that fail unpredictably when conditions shift.

## Key Arguments

**The Problem with Business Laws:**
Shipper critiques the historical attempts to make business scientific—from Adam Smith's invisible hand through Michael Porter's Five Forces to Clayton Christensen's disruption theory. He notes these frameworks provide helpful heuristics but lack the predictive power of actual scientific laws.

**Why Business Differs from Science:**
Several factors undermine business "laws":

1. **Equifinality & Multifinality**: Multiple paths lead to the same result, and identical approaches yield different outcomes (Apple's retail strategy succeeded brilliantly but failed at JC Penney).

2. **Impossible Experimentation**: You cannot A/B test major strategic decisions or simultaneously run competing versions of a company.

3. **Sensitive Dependence**: Small timing differences or minor market variations dramatically alter outcomes—the "butterfly effect."

4. **Hidden Exceptions**: Conditions making principles work or fail cannot be exhaustively specified in advance.

5. **Creative Subjectivity**: Determining customer needs requires participatory creativity, not objective observation.

## Critical Insight
"Business principles are usually anecdotes presented as axioms." They're valuable for experienced practitioners who understand tacit context, but dangerous when treated as universal laws.

## The Path Forward
Rather than memorizing rules, Shipper advocates developing gut-level pattern recognition—similar to how language models predict next tokens based on context.
