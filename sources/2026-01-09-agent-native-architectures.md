summary: "Dan Shipper's foundational essay on agent-native architecture: traditional apps are like skyscrapers (precise, load-tested blueprints); agent-native apps are like cities (emergent, self-organizing). Instead of coding features, you define tools (atomic actions) and let an AI agent compose behavior. This is the theory piece that underpins all the Every product experiments — includes a complete guide to agent-native architectures."

**Agent-native Architectures: How to Build Apps After the End of Code**

By Dan Shipper | January 9, 2026 | Chain of Thought

Traditional apps are like skyscrapers: precise blueprints, load-tested beams, every force obeys the plan. Agent-native apps are like cities: emergent, self-organizing, impossible to fully blueprint in advance.

Instead of coding features into the skyscraper, you define atomic tools (read/write/search) and let an AI agent compose behavior on demand — resulting in capabilities nobody explicitly programmed.

This is the foundational theory behind Every's product experiments with Cora, Sparkle, and Monologue. The complete guide is at every.to/guides/agent-native.
