summary: "Natalia Quintero (Every's head of consulting) interviewed 100+ companies and found the core problem is clarity, not technology — 'we have tools, we have power users, we don't know where to go.' Three blocking personas: skeptics, the overwhelmed, and tool-jumpers. Key difference from traditional software: AI tools require individual fluency, so adoption stays siloed. Success pattern: 3-5 AI champions (not top-down rollouts), peer-built tools that spread organically, leadership that models personal AI usage. 'You can only automate what you can clearly define.'"

# AI Adoption: What's Actually Working

## Main Thesis

Natalia Quintero, Every's head of consulting, interviewed over 100 companies about AI implementation. Her key finding: **the problem isn't technology—it's clarity**. Most organizations struggle not because AI tools don't work, but because they lack clear goals and processes for using them.

## The Core Challenge

"We have the tools. We have a few power users. We don't know where to go from here," is the recurring refrain Quintero hears. A widely cited MIT report claims 95% of generative AI pilots fail, but this reflects a clarity problem rather than a technology problem.

## Three User Personas Blocking Adoption

1. **Skeptics**: Uncomfortable with new technology, initial enthusiasm fades when learning becomes necessary
2. **The Overwhelmed**: Have tools but lack bandwidth to experiment alongside existing work
3. **Tool-Jumpers**: Analyze 30 different platforms without mastering any—disguised analysis paralysis

## Why AI Adoption Differs from Traditional Software

Unlike Asana, where one person's organization benefits everyone automatically, AI tools require individual fluency. Your custom prompts and workflows don't transfer to colleagues, creating isolated "lonely power users."

## The Success Story: The Recruiting Firm

Rather than company-wide rollouts, Quintero's team trained 10 AI champions—a mix of junior employees and leaders with willingness to learn, permission to build, freedom to fail, and eagerness to share.

One recruiter created a GPT automating scheduling coordination across three calendars, saving each recruiter 2-10 hours per scheduling task. Critically, **the tool's peer origin made it accessible**, sparking broader curiosity about automation.

## What Separates Successful Companies

- **Leadership models usage personally**: Leaders who use AI themselves understand both capabilities and limitations
- **Centralized testing**: Dedicated teams evaluate tools, preventing organization-wide tool-jumping
- **Champion-based rollouts**: Three to five people from different organizational levels build peer-to-peer solutions
- **Documentation culture**: Financial institutions and engineering teams possess natural advantages—they already document processes

## The Critical Insight

"You can only automate what you can clearly define." The hard part isn't using AI—it's determining what you're trying to achieve and how to accomplish it. Think of AI as training an intern: specificity about tone, process, success metrics, and pitfalls determines effectiveness.
