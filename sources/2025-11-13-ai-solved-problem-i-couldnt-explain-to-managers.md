summary: "Katie Parrott shares how AI tools (Cora email assistant, Monologue dictation, ChatGPT career coach) provided essential infrastructure for managing bipolar disorder at work — not by increasing productivity metrics, but by enabling consistent function. Key distinction: productivity (output metrics) vs. infrastructure (capacity and sustainability). Research shows neurodiverse workers report significantly higher AI satisfaction than neurotypical workers because it reduces friction that makes basic work feel impossible. 'The technologies that change the very texture of work might be the most valuable AI applications we build.'"

# AI Solved the Problem I Couldn't Explain to Managers

**By Katie Parrott | Every | November 13, 2025**

## Core Narrative

Parrott shares how AI tools provided essential support for managing bipolar disorder in a work context—not by increasing productivity metrics, but by creating the infrastructure necessary to function consistently.

## Key Arguments

**The Real Problem**: For years, Parrott struggled with inbox anxiety so severe it became physically paralyzing. She would avoid emails for weeks, missing deadlines and losing opportunities. Medication helped manage bipolar symptoms, but didn't address the external structure needed to prevent work from becoming overwhelming during depressive episodes.

**How AI Helps**: Tools like Cora (email assistant), Monologue (dictation), and ChatGPT (career coach) disrupted the cycle of anxiety and depression by:
- Reducing email clutter to manageable levels
- Removing friction from typing when depression creates resistance
- Maintaining organizational structure when the brain can't hold multiple tasks

**The Reframing**: Parrott distinguishes between productivity (output metrics) and infrastructure (capacity and sustainability). She writes: "These AI tools have given me something similar: the ability to move with ease in my brain."

## Broader Implications

Research suggests neurodiverse workers—those with ADHD, autism, and dyslexia—report significantly higher AI satisfaction than neurotypical workers, not because tools make them more productive, but because they reduce friction that makes basic work feel impossible.

**The Bottom Line**: "The technologies that change the very texture of work...might be the most valuable AI applications we build."
