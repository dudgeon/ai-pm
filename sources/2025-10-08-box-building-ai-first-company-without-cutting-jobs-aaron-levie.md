summary: "Aaron Levie (CEO, Box) argues AI will expand work via Jevons Paradox: when processes become cheaper, demand increases — faster contract review accelerates business, potentially adding headcount. Key distinction: AI automates 'tasks' not 'jobs' (jobs encompass judgment, collaboration, contextual decisions). Individual contributors increasingly resemble managers, allocating AI agents rather than executing directly. Three enterprise adoption lessons: frame AI as growth accelerant (not job threat), institutionalize learning via public demos, foster first-principles thinking about why processes take their current form."

# Article Extract: Box CEO Aaron Levie on AI and Employment

## Main Thesis
Box CEO Aaron Levie argues that AI agents will expand work rather than eliminate jobs, positioning artificial intelligence as a tool for growth within established organizations.

## Key Arguments

**Why Jobs Won't Disappear**
Levie distinguishes between "tasks" and "jobs." While AI excels at automating individual tasks, jobs encompass judgment, collaboration, and contextual decision-making that require human oversight. "AI excels at automating 'tasks,' but 'jobs' encompass much more" than what machines can fully replace.

**Jevons Paradox Application**
Drawing from 19th-century economic theory, Levie suggests that when processes become cheaper or faster, demand increases. If AI enables lawyers to review contracts twice as quickly, companies don't cut legal staff—they accelerate workflows, reduce bottlenecks, and potentially hire more people to handle expanded business.

**Shifting Work Dynamics**
Individual contributors increasingly resemble managers, allocating tasks to AI agents while exercising judgment about implementation. This represents a fundamental shift toward an "allocation economy" where directing intelligence—human or artificial—becomes primary work.

## Building AI-First Organizations

**Three Strategic Lessons from Box:**

1. **Frame AI as growth accelerant**, not job threat
2. **Institutionalize learning through public demonstrations** at company meetings
3. **Foster first-principles thinking** about why processes take their current duration

## Challenge for Established Companies
Levie acknowledges that legacy organizations may struggle compared to startups. Early-stage teams build "agent-first, prompt-driven" workflows from inception, while established companies layer new tools onto existing processes.
