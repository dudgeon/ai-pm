summary: "Hiten Shah (serial founder, Crazy Egg, KISSmetrics) on How I AI. Three advanced ChatGPT Project workflows: (1) 'What Would Morgan Do' — clone your boss by uploading their operating manual and favorite articles into a ChatGPT Project, use meta-prompting to generate project instructions, then rehearse pitches and difficult conversations with an AI that gives advice in your boss's specific style; (2) 'Personal OS' — upload personality framework results (Enneagram, Human Design, Myers-Briggs, DISC) for AI-powered self-coaching, combine with boss's profile for relationship-specific advice, use for real-time emotional regulation; (3) Operationalize sales frameworks — upload Winning by Design PDFs, generate customized SPICE discovery guides for specific products, enrich with deep research context. Core principle: great outputs require great inputs — show AI what 'great' looks like through structured context and examples."

## Summary

How I AI episode with Hiten Shah, serial founder (Crazy Egg, KISSmetrics), one of the most advanced ChatGPT users. Three workflows using ChatGPT Projects for persistent, context-aware AI assistants: (1) "What Would Morgan Do" — clone your boss by uploading their operating manual and articles into a ChatGPT Project, use meta-prompting to generate project instructions, rehearse pitches with an AI that gives advice in boss's specific style; (2) "Personal OS" — upload personality assessments (Enneagram Type 9, Human Design 1/3, Myers-Briggs, DISC) for AI self-coaching, combine with boss's profile for relationship-specific strategies, use for real-time emotional regulation and perspective shifts; (3) Operationalize sales frameworks — upload Winning by Design PDFs, generate SPICE discovery guides customized for specific products, enrich with deep research context. Core principle: great outputs require great inputs — show AI what "great" looks like with structured context and examples.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **ChatGPT Projects as specialized AI assistants**: Persistent context, uploaded files, and custom instructions create dedicated spaces loaded with domain knowledge
- **Meta-prompting for project setup**: Ask ChatGPT to generate its own project instructions from uploaded documents — clever shortcut that produces better instructions than writing them yourself
- **Clone your boss for conversation rehearsal**: Upload manager's operating manual and articles, then rehearse pitches and difficult conversations with an AI that responds in their specific style
- **Personal OS for self-coaching**: Upload personality framework results for AI-powered emotional regulation, relationship navigation, and perspective shifts — like having an executive coach on-call 24/7
- **Combine personal + interpersonal context**: Cross-reference your Enneagram/DISC with your boss's type for relationship-specific communication strategies
- **Operationalize static frameworks**: Turn dense sales methodology PDFs into interactive tools that generate customized scripts on demand
- **Two-step enrichment pattern**: First teach AI the framework, then provide specific subject matter context for highly tailored outputs
- **Great outputs require great inputs**: The key differentiator is doing the work upfront to provide context, frameworks, and examples of what "great" looks like
