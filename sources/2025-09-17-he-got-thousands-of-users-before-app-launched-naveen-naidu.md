summary: "Naveen Naidu (Monologue GM) on pre-launch audience building: never build in darkness (dedicated Discord channel from day one, single power user as north star — 'if I keep Kieran happy, I'll keep a ton of people happy'). Fast-ship muscle: ship four products, expect most to fail, iterate on signals. Dogfooding as feature development: the 'auto-enter' feature emerged from his own frustration using Monologue while coding it. Technical stack: Windsurf for early experiments, Claude Code for most of codebase, OpenAI Codex for complex problems. Post-launch: 1 million words transcribed weekly, users switching from venture-backed competitors."

# Monologue: Building Thousands of Users Before Launch

## Overview
Naveen Naidu, an entrepreneur in residence at Every, built an AI voice dictation app called Monologue that achieved product-market fit in reverse—accumulating thousands of users during beta before its official launch.

## Key Success Strategies

### Building a Fast-Ship Muscle
Naidu developed rapid prototyping skills through multiple iterations. Before Monologue, he shipped TL;DR (AI podcast generator), Kairos (reading companion), and Unwrite (grammar fixer). His approach emphasized: "I have a small idea, just code it up, and release it." He learned to launch with minimal features and iterate based on feedback rather than waiting for perfection.

### Never Building in Darkness
A critical lesson came from spending six months on an email marketing client he never shared. With Monologue, Naidu established a dedicated Discord channel for continuous feedback. He credits Kieran Klaassen, Cora's GM, with brutally honest product critiques that shaped the final product: "If I keep Kieran happy, I'm going to keep a ton of people happy."

### Dogfooding as Feature Development
The app's standout "auto-enter" feature—which automatically submits dictation without keyboard input—emerged from Naidu's own frustration using Monologue while coding it.

## Technical Stack
- **Windsurf**: Early agentic coding experiments
- **Claude Code**: Built most of Monologue's codebase
- **OpenAI's Codex**: Used for complex problems, praised for precision and logical code

For especially difficult challenges, Codex solved macOS hotkey issues in hours—work that "would've been a $200,000 project" previously.

## Results
Post-launch metrics show 1 million words transcribed weekly, with users switching from venture-backed competitors.
