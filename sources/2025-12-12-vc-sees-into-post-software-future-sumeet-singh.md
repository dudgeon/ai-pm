summary: "Sumeet Singh (Worldbuild VC) shares a 3-step research framework for identifying post-software opportunities: (1) design your information ecosystem (algorithm hacking, primary sources, multi-AI stress-testing), (2) identify the granular catalyst (not the trend itself but what enables it), (3) generate conviction via founder-oriented hypotheses. Investment thesis: win via infrastructure the models need (compute, on-device AI, data exchanges, security) OR via truly novel apps impossible without AI — not SaaS wrappers. Case study: Sardine (fraud in crypto → fintech compliance, 10x return)."

# How This Venture Capitalist Sees Into the Post-Software Future

## Key Arguments

Venture capitalist Sumeet Singh from Worldbuild employs a systematic three-step process to identify emerging technological opportunities and predict future market winners in the AI era.

## Singh's Research Framework

**Step 1: Design Your Information Ecosystem**

Singh curates information through multiple methods:

- **Algorithm hacking**: Deliberately searching topics repeatedly on social media to train algorithms to surface relevant content
- **Primary sources**: Consulting archives like the Wayback Machine and speaking directly with industry veterans to understand historical technology shifts
- **Multiple AI perspectives**: Running parallel analyses with different language models role-playing as respected investors to stress-test ideas

He consolidates findings in a single Notion document, hoping patterns will emerge over time.

**Step 2: Identify the Catalyst**

Singh distinguishes between surface-level trends and the subtle technological shifts that enable them. Rather than focusing on "massive top-down" forces like AI itself, he hunts for granular catalysts—such as the Mac mini gaining sufficient memory to run local models practically.

**Step 3: Generate Conviction**

Singh translates research into actionable hypotheses by considering: What products become possible? How do distribution dynamics shift? What value stacks form? This founder-oriented approach helps him develop sharper investment theses.

## Core Investment Thesis

Singh argues successful AI-era companies will win in two ways:

1. **Infrastructure layer**: Providing compute, data, energy, and security infrastructure
2. **New applications**: Building apps designed around AI capabilities rather than retrofitting AI into existing workflows

## Case Study: Sardine

Singh's 2021 observation of fraud proliferation in crypto markets led him to invest in Sardine, which solved compliance problems across fintech. The company later raised Series C funding at 10x his entry valuation, demonstrating the value of identifying second-order effects.
