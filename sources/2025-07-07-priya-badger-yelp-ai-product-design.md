summary: "Priya Badger (PM, Yelp) presents three workflows: (1) designing conversational AI products by writing 'golden conversations' in Claude then generating interactive LLM-powered prototypes via Artifacts, (2) using Magic Patterns' Inspiration Mode to rapidly explore UI design variations, (3) applying AI prototyping to personal projects as skill-building. Key distinction: managing products WITH AI, not just AI products."

# Designing AI Products by Starting with Conversations: Priya Badger's Workflow at Yelp

**By**: Priya Badger
**Host**: Claire Vo
**Source**: [How I AI (ChatPRD / Lenny's Podcast Network)](https://www.chatprd.ai/how-i-ai/ai-product-management-and-prototyping-at-yelp)
**Type**: podcast

## Summary

Three workflows demonstrated. **Workflow 1**: Designing conversational AI by writing "golden conversations" — sample dialogues showing the ideal user experience — then iterating with real images, refining based on patterns observed (image recognition quality, conversation flow, conciseness), and using Claude Artifacts to generate interactive LLM-powered prototypes with auto-generated system prompts. **Workflow 2**: Using Magic Patterns' Inspiration Mode to rapidly explore multiple UI design variations side-by-side for new AI features (e.g., photo upload entry points), replacing slow PM-designer back-and-forth with instant visual exploration. **Workflow 3**: Applying the same techniques to personal projects (community newsletter summarizer via Claude Projects, a "Parent Pal" advisor, a Settlers of Catan timer in Lovable) as low-pressure practice for AI PM skills.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **Golden conversations as requirements**: Start with example dialogues showing ideal interaction flow rather than traditional wireframes or PRDs — for conversational AI, the conversation IS the prototype
- **Inside-out product design**: Begin with the end-user experience (the conversation), then work backward to requirements — inverts the traditional linear development process
- **Claude Artifacts for interactive prototyping**: Generate working chat interfaces that use the same LLM powering Claude, producing both a prototype AND an auto-generated system prompt derived from your example conversations
- **Qualitative pattern checking before formal evals**: Review generated conversations for image recognition quality, flow, conciseness, and comprehensibility before building rubrics
- **Magic Patterns Inspiration Mode**: Generate multiple distinct UI options simultaneously for side-by-side comparison — accelerates early-stage design exploration
- **Personal projects as AI PM training**: Building personal tools (newsletter summarizer, parenting advisor, game timer) provides hands-on AI product experience without needing a formal AI PM role
- **Claude Projects for repeatable tasks**: Save instructions and context for recurring work (e.g., weekly newsletter formatting from Slack exports)

## Notes

- Published on ChatPRD blog Oct 20, 2025 (episode aired ~Jul 7, 2025). 11-min read.
- Context: Yelp's AI assistant for matching users with service professionals; photo upload feature was the specific problem space
- Priya makes explicit distinction: she manages products WITH AI, not just AI products
- Tools referenced: Claude (conversations + Artifacts), Magic Patterns (UI exploration), Lovable (personal project), Figma (existing workflow comparison)
- Personal projects mentioned: community newsletter (Slack → Claude Projects), Parent Pal (Artifacts), Settlers of Catan timer (Lovable)
