## Overview

Reid Robinson, lead product manager for AI at Zapier, discusses how businesses can effectively integrate generative AI into their operations through the automation platform.

## Key Points

Robinson emphasizes a practical approach to AI adoption: "I try to tie that back to the problems we have" rather than focusing exclusively on emerging capabilities. He suggests businesses identify persistent operational challenges — their "skeleton-in-the-closet" problems — where generative AI might provide solutions.

The Zapier executive highlights the importance of understanding where AI performs reliably. He notes that familiarity with these capabilities helps organizations recognize what's achievable.

## Real-World Applications

Zapier's ChatGPT integration, launched in 2022, became "some of our fastest-growing app integrations ever," according to Robinson. He identifies substantial untapped potential for AI-powered workflows.

Robinson points to practical use cases, including automated email drafting where ChatGPT generates customized responses based on user templates, requiring only final review before sending.

Last year, Zapier introduced Formatter with AI, enabling users to describe data reformatting needs in natural language, eliminating manual editing work.

## Vision

Robinson believes "we've only scratched the surface" of generative AI's potential for workflow automation, noting many users remain unaware of AI capabilities available within Zapier's ecosystem.
