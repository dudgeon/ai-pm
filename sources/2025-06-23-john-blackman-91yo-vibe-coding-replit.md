summary: "John Blackman (91yo retired electrical engineer) on How I AI. Two-part workflow to build a complex church event management app with no prior software dev experience: (1) Claude as AI product manager — fed detailed Word document outlining user journey, Claude generated professional-grade user stories for multiple roles (system admin, local admin, pastor, participant), multi-tenant architecture with role-based access control, MVP definition, phased rollout plan, and non-functional requirements; (2) Replit agent as AI developer — pasted entire Claude blueprint into Replit agent, which built file structure, database schema, frontend and backend; iterative vibe-coding cycle of prompting, observing, testing, feedback. Final app features: admin dashboard with multi-tenant access, event/service management, automated Excel reports, VIN lookup via OpenAI API for oil change shopping lists, QR code registration, digital signature waivers, personalized Impact Passport PDFs via SendGrid. Built for ~$350 in a few weeks vs. estimated 6 months with traditional team."

# How a 91-Year-Old Vibe-Coded a Complex Church App with Claude and Replit

## Summary

How I AI episode with John Blackman, a 91-year-old retired electrical engineer, and his grandson Brandon. John built a sophisticated multi-tenant event management application for his church's "Impact Weekends" (community outreach events providing free services) with no prior software development experience. Two-part workflow: (1) Claude as AI product manager — fed a detailed Word document describing the user journey, Claude generated professional-grade user stories for multiple roles (system admin, local church admin, pastor, participant), designed multi-tenant architecture with role-based access control, proposed an MVP with phased rollout plan, and outlined non-functional requirements for security and privacy; (2) Replit agent as AI developer — pasted entire Claude requirements blueprint into Replit agent, which immediately generated file structure, database schema, and frontend/backend code; iterative vibe-coding cycle of prompting, observing, testing, and providing feedback. Final application features: secure admin dashboard with multi-tenant access, event and service management with toggle controls, automated Excel reporting suite (demographics, service usage, shopping lists), VIN lookup via OpenAI API for oil change shopping lists, QR code participant registration, digital signature waivers, personalized "Impact Passport" PDFs emailed via SendGrid. Built for ~$350 in a few weeks of late-night sessions vs. estimated six months with a traditional team.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **Claude as AI product manager**: Feed a detailed Word document of your vision and get back professional-grade user stories, multi-tenant architecture, MVP definition, phased rollout, and non-functional requirements
- **Replit agent as AI developer**: Paste the entire Claude blueprint into Replit and the agent builds file structure, database schema, and full-stack code — John described watching in amazement at the speed
- **Two-tool workflow: plan then build**: Use one AI (Claude) for product planning and another (Replit) for implementation — clear handoff via copy-pasting the requirements document
- **Iterative vibe-coding feedback loop**: Prompt → observe → test → feedback; know when to say "Wait" or "Stop" when the agent goes down a "rabbit trail"
- **$350 vs. 6 months**: A non-developer built a complex multi-tenant app with API integrations for roughly $350 in a few weeks, replacing what would have been a six-month professional development effort
- **Lifelong learning mindset**: John compares AI adoption to learning AutoCAD in the 1980s — those who embraced new tools extended their careers and continued having impact
- **Sophisticated features from conversational prompts**: Multi-tenant access control, VIN lookup API integration, SendGrid email delivery, digital signatures, Excel report generation — all built through natural language interaction
- **AI empowers community problem-solving**: John saw a real problem (paper-based event registration) and had the tools to solve it himself, creating positive community impact without waiting for budget or developers
