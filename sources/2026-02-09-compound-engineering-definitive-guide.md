summary: "Kieran Klaassen introduces 'compound engineering' — the principle that each unit of AI-assisted engineering work should make subsequent work easier and smarter, inverting the typical complexity debt trajectory. This is a launch post for a comprehensive guide at every.to/guides/compound-engineering, plus an installable Claude Code plugin on GitHub. Core idea: AI learns from your patterns over time so the codebase becomes more AI-navigable with each PR."

By Kieran Klaassen | February 9, 2026 | Source Code

Software used to be built by armies of engineers. Now, with AI, Every runs all five of its products with a two-person engineering team.

When I started building Cora, our AI email assistant, from scratch, I wanted to see how much I could enable with AI assistance. I found I could ship like five engineers.

This evolved into a systematic approach to AI-assisted development that I call compound engineering.

**The philosophy**

The core philosophy of compound engineering is that each unit of engineering work should make subsequent work easier and smarter. Most codebases get harder to work with over time because each feature you add injects more complexity and fragility into the system.

Compound engineering flips this on its head. Instead of features adding complexity and fragility, they add shared understanding between you and your AI pair programmer. Every PR, bug fix, and code review becomes permanent lessons your AI coding tool carries into the next task.

**The complete guide to compound engineering**

Today, we're publishing a complete guide to compound engineering on Every. It has everything from a high-level breakdown of compound-engineering principles to low-level implementation details.

The full guide is available at: https://every.to/guides/compound-engineering

The compound engineering plugin (installable for Claude Code) is available on GitHub: https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
