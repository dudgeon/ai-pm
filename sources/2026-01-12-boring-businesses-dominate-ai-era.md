**The Boring Businesses That Will Dominate the AI Era**

By Tina He | January 12, 2026 | Thesis

In a world where AI agents become primary users, Tina He (Pace Capital) identifies five irreplaceable business archetypes — not the best models or slickest interfaces, but the ones that own boring, essential infrastructure.

Five archetypes:
1. **Knowledge compounders**: Data that learns while you sleep — proprietary datasets that improve as agents use them
2. **Workflow commons**: Templates that capture how work happens — reusable workflow patterns that agents pull from
3. **Reality's gatekeepers**: Toll booths between AI and consequences — compliance, verification, physical-world integration
4. **The marketplace**: Trading floors for algorithmic buyers — platforms where AI agents transact
5. **Vertical transformers**: Replace the workflow, not the worker — deep vertical integration that AI can't easily substitute

The common thread: each archetype compounds — it gets more valuable the more it's used.
