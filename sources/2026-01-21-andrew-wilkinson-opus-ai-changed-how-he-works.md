summary: "Andrew Wilkinson (Tiny cofounder) describes using AI to build personal tools: a relationship counselor, an AI email client, and a personal stylist — all built with Opus 4.5. His investing thesis is shifting: he's rethinking software businesses because AI commoditizes code, so moats must now come from something other than code (brand, data, relationships). Key contrarian take: if you can build any software yourself with AI, what makes a software business defensible?"

**Opus 4.5 Changed How Andrew Wilkinson Works and Lives**
*Tiny's cofounder on the relationship counselor, email client, and personal stylist he created with AI—and why he's rethinking software investing*

By Rhea Purohit (article) / Hosted by Dan Shipper | January 21, 2026 | AI & I Podcast

Andrew Wilkinson, cofounder of Tiny (a holding company that buys profitable businesses), sits down with Dan Shipper to discuss how Opus 4.5 changed his work and personal life.

Key themes:
- **How Wilkinson uses AI in work and personal life**: Built custom AI tools — a relationship counselor, an AI email client, a personal stylist — all using Opus 4.5 without traditional coding
- **Why you need to find a moat that isn't code**: As AI commoditizes software development, the defensible parts of software businesses are increasingly non-code (brand, data, relationships, distribution) — Wilkinson is actively rethinking his investment thesis for software businesses
