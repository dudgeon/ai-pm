summary: "Natalia Quintero (Every's head of consulting) shares three patterns she sees in AI-forward companies: top-down commitment from CEOs, empowering internal early adopters, and giving creative space to experiment. Concrete example: a private equity firm reduced investment memo creation from weeks to 30 minutes by encoding their investment philosophy as Claude Skills. Quintero herself built 'Claudie,' an AI project manager that cut her weekly PM workload from 15 hours to 1 hour."

**Every's Head of Consulting Just Automated Her Job**
*Natalia Quintero on why resources and fancy tools don't predict success, the power of internal AI champions, and how Claudie, their AI project manager, cut her weekly workload from 15 hours to one*

By Tom Matsuda (article) / Hosted by Dan Shipper | February 4, 2026 | AI & I Podcast

Dan Shipper sits down with Natalia Quintero, Every's head of consulting, about what she has learned from helping companies adopt AI and how they built Claudie — an AI project manager that automated most of her own work.

**Characteristics of the most AI-forward companies:**

**1. There is a coordinated effort from the top**

Natalia says that several key characteristics separate the companies thriving with AI from those floundering. "For AI to be a high-leverage tool at any given company, it needs to come from the top down," she says.

This is fundamentally different from how companies have historically adopted software, where company-wide adoption was usually driven by a bottom-up wave of enthusiasm from the workforce.

Dan agrees. He says the companies going the furthest have CEOs deep in ChatGPT and Claude Code. He cites Shopify's Tobias Lütke, who even made his own MRI viewer using AI. He says that an organization's ability to adapt AI is directly correlated with its chief executive's personal engagement with the tools.

**2. They empower AI early adopters**

The second critical pattern that Natalia and Dan see among successful adopters of AI is that those companies spotlight their internal early adopters—people who are using AI even without an official mandate.

"Inside of any organization, there are people who are just natural early adopters," Shipper notes. "Finding those people and getting them to share what they're doing is one of the highest leverage things a manager can do."

One of Natalia's most striking examples: a private equity firm where partner Jonathan not only had technical knowledge but worked closely with every investor to map their specific AI use cases. This helped Every build "a very, very detailed view of what it looks like at this firm"—allowing them to create custom tools for sifting through investment theses. The result: that process went from weeks to 30 minutes.

"That's only possible when you have someone on the inside who understands all of the elements," she says.

**3. They give people creative space to experiment**

Companies that give people risk-free space to try new technology, learn its ins and outs, and fail without consequences see dramatically better AI adoption.

"Having that creative space is very, very counterintuitive to the way that we usually work," Natalia says.

Natalia herself fell into the trap she often sees with clients — her days were packed with back-to-back meetings with no time for experimentation. To combat this, she and Nityesh Agarwal (an Every engineer) started their workday at 6 a.m. every day to vibe code with AI.

The result: Claudie, an AI project manager running on Opus 4.5 in the Every GitHub. With Claudie, Natalia's weekly project management workload was cut from 15 hours to one. But it wasn't easy: "We got 85 percent of the way there three times and then had to scrap it and start again to get to a product we were happy with."

The Claudie system includes a detailed "job description" that Claudie reads every time it's asked to complete a task, but it can still make mistakes—so you have to teach the system to rectify its errors when they occur.
