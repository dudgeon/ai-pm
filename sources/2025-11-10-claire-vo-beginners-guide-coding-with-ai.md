summary: "Claire Vo solo episode: complete zero-to-one walkthrough for non-coders. Four workflows: (1) PRD generation with ChatGPT, (2) building a Next.js personal project hub from scratch in Cursor 2.0's Agents view, (3) creating reusable AI agent instruction files in markdown for consistent document generation, (4) vibe-coding a clickable prototype from a PRD. Includes a failed v0 attempt (lesson in AI scope creep) and GitHub Desktop for beginner-friendly version control."

# A Beginner's Guide to Coding with AI—Build Your First Project Hub

**By**: Claire Vo
**Source**: [How I AI (ChatPRD / Lenny's Podcast Network)](https://www.chatprd.ai/how-i-ai/beginners-guide-to-coding-with-ai-build-your-first-project-hub)
**Type**: podcast

## Summary

Solo mini-episode targeting absolute beginners. Four workflows demonstrated live and unscripted, including a real failure. **Workflow 1**: Generate a PRD with ChatGPT as the project plan. **Workflow 2 (failed)**: Attempted v0 for UI generation but it over-built — added file management, code sandboxes, and features far beyond the minimal hub requested. Key lesson: agentic tools can introduce scope creep. **Workflow 3 (main)**: Built a Next.js personal project hub from an empty folder in Cursor 2.0 using the Agents view — scaffolded app, ran locally with `npm run dev`, set up GitHub Desktop for version control. **Workflow 4**: Created reusable AI agent instruction files (markdown files in an `agents/` folder) that define document templates — then referenced these instructions in prompts for consistent PRD generation. **Workflow 5**: Vibe-coded a clickable prototype from the PRD, iterated on UI issues by dragging screenshots into Cursor's chat.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **Start with PRD, not code**: Write requirements first to clarify thinking and give AI better direction — same principle regardless of skill level
- **Agentic tools can over-build**: v0 tried to create a complete application instead of a minimal hub — "scope creep" is an AI tool failure mode; when it happens, pivot quickly
- **Cursor Agents view for beginners**: Hides file complexity and lets new coders focus on instructing the AI what to build
- **Agent instruction files as reusable templates**: Markdown files in an `agents/` folder define document structure/rules; reference them in prompts with `@filename` for consistent output across sessions
- **Screenshot-driven UI debugging**: Drag a screenshot of a visual bug into Cursor's chat for instant identification and fix
- **GitHub Desktop for non-technical users**: Visual interface for version control concepts (commits, branches) — much easier than command line for beginners
- **Cost of failed experiments is low**: The v0 detour cost ~10 minutes and taught a valuable lesson — pivoting is part of the process
- **Personal projects as "safe spaces"**: Building something just for yourself removes pressure and makes learning enjoyable

## Notes

- Published Nov 5, 2025 on ChatPRD blog. 9-min read. Solo episode (no guest).
- This is also listed as a Matt Britton double episode in the compilation — Matt Britton's mega-workflow (25k hours of sales calls → self-learning GTM engine) was Part 2 of same recording
- Tools: ChatGPT (PRD), v0 (failed attempt), Cursor 2.0 with Composer One model, GitHub Desktop, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- The episode is positioned as the entry-point episode for the entire How I AI catalog
