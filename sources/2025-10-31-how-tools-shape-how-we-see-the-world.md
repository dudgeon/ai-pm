summary: "Dan Shipper argues that tools shape cognition: 'the complexity of our tools changes the complexity of our reality,' and each era conceptualizes the mind through its most advanced technology (wax tablet → clockwork → steam engine → computer). Traditional computers reinforced reductionist thinking (binary logic, isolatable components). Language models represent a paradigm shift: they operate through distributed neural networks recognizing non-linear patterns — revealing aspects of reality that defy reductionism. 'To someone with a language model, everything is a rich and intricate web of interconnectivity.'"

# How Tools Shape How We See the World

## Main Argument

Dan Shipper explores how our tools fundamentally shape our perception of reality. He argues that "the complexity of our tools changes the complexity of our reality," and that each historical era has adopted metaphors for intelligence based on its most advanced technology.

## Historical Framework

Shipper traces how different eras conceptualized the mind through their tools:

- **Plato** viewed memory as impressions on a wax tablet
- **Descartes** imagined the cosmos as clockwork with mechanical parts
- **Freud** used steam engine metaphors for the mind
- Today we describe cognition using computer terminology—"bandwidth," "processing," "rewiring"

## The Reductionist Worldview

For 2,000 years, Western philosophy emphasized breaking reality into measurable, isolatable components. This reflected the limitations of available tools, which could only handle what was reducible. Traditional computers, built on binary logic, reinforced this fragmented approach.

## Language Models as New Lens

Language models represent a paradigm shift. Unlike rule-based systems, they operate through distributed, interconnected neural networks that recognize non-linear patterns. This tool reveals aspects of reality that defy the reductionist framework—complexity, context, and interconnectedness.

## Personal Context

Shipper shares his journey seeking the "perfect" note-taking system, ultimately recognizing that mechanical, rule-based systems inevitably break down when applied to open-ended problems. This mirrors the limitations he identifies in traditional philosophy and technology.

## Key Insight

"To someone with a hammer, everything is a nail," but with a language model, "everything is a rich and intricate web of interconnectivity."
