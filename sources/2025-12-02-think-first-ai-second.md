summary: "Economics lecturer Ines Lee uses MIT research to argue that sequencing matters: students who thought first then used AI (brain → AI) maintained cognitive engagement comparable to AI-avoiders, while those starting with AI remained mentally passive even after switching to independent work. Frames two modes: passive AI use (outsourcing cognition for mechanical tasks) vs. active AI use (AI as challenge to your reasoning, for judgment-heavy work where understanding your own reasoning matters for sustainability and adaptability). As critical thinking becomes scarce, its value rises."

# "Think First, AI Second" - Article Summary

## Main Thesis
Economics lecturer Ines Lee argues that the solution to AI dependency isn't avoiding AI, but using it strategically. She advocates for thinking independently first, then leveraging AI as a tool, rather than outsourcing cognition entirely.

## Key Research Finding
MIT researchers discovered that sequencing matters crucially. Students who thought first then used AI (brain → AI) maintained cognitive engagement comparable to those avoiding AI entirely. Conversely, those starting with AI remained mentally passive even after switching to independent work.

## Core Framework: Active vs. Passive Use

**Passive AI use:** Letting the model generate answers without building your own understanding—like memorizing piano by hand position alone.

**Active AI use:** Building comprehension while collaborating with AI, using it to challenge assumptions and expose blind spots—equivalent to learning music theory alongside technique.

## The Stakes
As critical thinking abilities decline among younger workers, employers increasingly demand precisely these capabilities: defending reasoning, adapting to new contexts, and identifying approach failures.

## Practical Distinction
Passive use suits mechanical tasks (transcription, routine reports). Active use applies to judgment-heavy work where understanding your reasoning—not just producing output—matters for sustainability and adaptability.
