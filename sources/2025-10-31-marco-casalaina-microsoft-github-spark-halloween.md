# Halloween Special: Live-Coding a Kid-Friendly AI Fortune Teller App with GitHub Spark

**By**: Marco Casalaina
**Host**: Claire Vo
**Source**: [How I AI (ChatPRD / Lenny's Podcast Network)](https://www.chatprd.ai/how-i-ai/vibe-coding-ai-fortune-teller-app-for-halloween-with-github-spark)
**Type**: podcast

## Summary

Impromptu Halloween episode. **Main workflow**: Live vibe-coding a mobile fortune teller app using GitHub Spark through purely conversational prompts. Started with a simple prompt defining app type, action, and theme. First output was poetic but too abstract for young kids. Three iterative refinements made it progressively more concrete, humorous, and age-appropriate — demonstrating how natural language serves as the development interface. Spark auto-generated PRD, HTML, CSS, and JS from each prompt. **Pro-tip section**: SpecKit for complex engineering work — AI analyzes feature specs as you write them and surfaces clarifying questions about edge cases and ambiguities, forcing deeper problem-solving before development starts. Works with Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **Conversational iteration as development**: Simple text prompts serve as the full development interface — define, review, refine through natural language without touching code
- **Prompt refinement pattern**: Abstract → concrete + kid-friendly → concrete + humorous + simple vocabulary — each iteration gave more specific constraints
- **GitHub Spark for rapid prototyping**: Generates PRD + full HTML/CSS/JS from a text prompt; ideal for small creative projects
- **SpecKit for complex projects**: AI as specification partner rather than code generator — asks clarifying questions to identify edge cases and ambiguities before development begins
- **Builder mindset in product leadership**: VP-level product leader who still codes daily — demonstrates the value of maintaining hands-on technical skills
- **AI accessibility democratization**: You don't need to be a professional developer to build functional apps — clear vision + willingness to iterate through conversation is sufficient

## Notes

- Published Oct 31, 2025 on ChatPRD blog. 7-min read. Shorter/lighter episode due to being impromptu.
- Tools: GitHub Spark (vibe coding), SpecKit (spec writing), GitHub Copilot
- The episode happened because an expired corporate credit card prevented the scheduled recording — Marco improvised with a project he was already building
- This is one of the simpler/lighter episodes — less PM methodology, more accessible vibe-coding demonstration
