summary: "Mike Taylor (ex-50-person agency CEO) argues that AI management and human management are converging: the same techniques that help AI models perform — clear context, decomposed tasks, consistent feedback loops — are what good managers have always done with humans. He calls this 'New Taylorism.' Key sections: prompting belongs in business school, managers have been vibe coding forever (giving vague direction and hoping), the rise of the 'idea guy,' and where humans still shine (the messy middle of judgment calls)."

**What AI Is Teaching Us About Management**

By Mike Taylor | January 20, 2026 | Also True for Humans

Mike Taylor's column thesis: managing AIs and managing humans require the same techniques. The issues he encounters with AI tools (inconsistency, hallucination, lack of creativity) are the same issues he had managing a 50-person marketing agency.

Key sections:
- **Prompting belongs in business school**: Writing clear instructions is a management skill; MBA programs should teach it
- **Managers have been vibe coding forever**: Most managers give vague direction ("make it better") and hope — same failure mode as vague AI prompts
- **The age of the idea guy**: AI shifts value to people who generate clear ideas and can evaluate output, not those who execute
- **Where humans shine: The messy middle**: Novel judgment calls, stakeholder politics, ethical gray areas — the things that can't be reduced to a spec
- **What comes next**: "New Taylorism" — systematic, prompt-driven management becomes standard practice
