summary: "Katie Parrott builds a 'writing brain' — a customized ChatGPT project trained on her published essays with four components: overview and mission, core directives (signature structure: friction → zoom out → usable framework), red flags (writing weaknesses to avoid: hedging, meandering intros), performance playbooks (which patterns drive reach vs. engagement). Uses AI iteratively as a 'sparring partner' across brainstorming, outlining, drafting, revising. Key insight: 'AI can write like you if you teach it how' — requires patience and recursive feedback rather than one-shot prompts."

## Raw Content

# Article Summary: Building a Personalized AI Writing Partner

## Core Concept

Katie Parrott describes creating a "writing brain"—a customized ChatGPT project trained on her published essays to learn her voice, patterns, and standards. She feeds the model her work, asks "What do you notice?" and builds a living style guide that enforces her writing principles.

## Key Framework

The system has four main components:

1. **Overview and Mission** - Establishes what the column should accomplish
2. **Core Directives** - Captures her signature structure: starting with friction, zooming out to broader context, landing on usable frameworks
3. **Red Flags** - Documents her writing weaknesses (hedging, meandering intros) to avoid
4. **Performance Playbooks** - Tracks which patterns drive reach versus engagement

## The Process

Parrott uses AI iteratively across brainstorming, outlining, drafting, and revising. Rather than expecting perfect output immediately, she workshopes structures and treats the model as a "sparring partner" throughout development.

## Key Insight

She emphasizes that "AI can write like you if you teach it how." The approach requires patience and recursive feedback rather than one-shot prompts.
