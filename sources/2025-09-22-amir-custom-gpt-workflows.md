summary: "Amir Klein (AI PM, monday.com — ranked #4 of 90 PMs in AI tool usage) on How I AI. Three workflows for offloading PM mental burden to AI: (1) AI-powered 'second brain' for product management and customer feedback — creates dedicated project folders in Claude/ChatGPT loaded with kickoff decks, PRDs, and product docs ('everything is text' mindset); used Claude to build a Reddit scraper (Python script, no deep coding skills) that pulled 34,000 rows of customer conversations about monday.com and AI agents; fed CSV back to Claude for frequency/percentage/weight analysis with citation verification; configured AI persona to give candid feedback and challenge ideas rather than being 'super supportive'; (2) Custom GPT writing coach for concise communication — uploaded Wes Kao's frameworks from Lenny's Newsletter plus 'On Writing Well' and 'Elements of Style' as PDFs; GPT rewrites Slack messages to be concise while maintaining natural voice; daily draft-paste-iterate loop; resulted in measurably more responses to his Slack messages; (3) Product interview prep with GPT Voice Mode — custom GPT loaded with interview structure (product sense vs. execution), expert resources, CV, and target job; Voice Mode simulates realistic mock interviews with candid feedback and no hints; tracks improvement over multiple sessions. Core insight: AI as always-available second brain, writing coach, and interview partner lets PMs offload context switching and focus on strategic thinking."

## Summary

How I AI episode with Amir Klein, AI PM at monday.com (ranked #4 of 90 PMs in AI tool usage, even after two months of paternity leave). Three workflows showing how to offload PM mental burden to AI: (1) AI-powered "second brain" for product management and customer feedback — creates dedicated project folders in Claude and ChatGPT loaded with kickoff decks, PRDs, product documentation, and marketing pages as PDFs ("everything is text" mindset); used Claude to write a Python Reddit scraper (no deep coding skills required) that pulled 34,000 rows of conversations about monday.com and AI agents; fed the CSV back to Claude for frequency, percentage, weight, and key discussion point analysis with citation verification to prevent hallucination; configured the AI persona to give candid feedback, challenge ideas, and push back rather than being supportive of every idea; uses the brain for PRD drafting and quick stakeholder answers; (2) Custom GPT writing coach for concise professional communication — uploaded Wes Kao's concise writing frameworks from Lenny's Newsletter plus "On Writing Well" (Zinsser) and "The Elements of Style" (Strunk & White) as PDFs; GPT rewrites Slack messages to be concise and clear while maintaining natural voice with specific style directives (avoid dashes, limit bullet points); daily draft-paste-iterate coaching loop; resulted in measurably more responses to his Slack messages; (3) Product interview prep with GPT Voice Mode — custom GPT loaded with product sense and execution interview structures, expert coaching resources, personal CV, and target job link; Voice Mode simulates realistic conversational mock interviews with candid feedback and no hints or guidance; tracks improvement across sessions (e.g., "your user segmentation has improved"). Also applicable to public speaking practice and reading comprehension.

## Key Ideas Extracted

- **Dedicated AI "second brains" per initiative**: Create separate project folders in Claude/ChatGPT loaded with all context (kickoff decks, PRDs, docs, site PDFs) — offloads the mental burden of context switching across multiple projects
- **"Everything is text" mindset**: Print web pages, marketing sites, and support pages as PDFs to upload into AI projects — any information can become part of the AI's knowledge base
- **Claude-generated Reddit scraper for customer feedback**: Asked Claude to write a Python script for Reddit API scraping with "explain it like I'm five" instructions — pulled 34,000 rows of genuine customer conversations without deep technical skills
- **Citation verification against hallucination**: After AI analysis, ask it to provide specific quotes from the source data for its claims, then manually check those citations — critical quality control for large-scale feedback analysis
- **Configure AI persona for candid pushback**: Explicitly instruct the AI to challenge ideas and not be "too nice" or "super supportive of every idea" — makes it a better thought partner
- **Custom GPT writing coach with expert sources**: Upload expert frameworks (Wes Kao, Strunk & White, Zinsser) and set specific style constraints — creates an always-available coaching loop that's faster than human feedback
- **GPT Voice Mode for realistic interview simulation**: Conversational format simulates real interview pressure in ways typing can't — configure to give no hints, let you take the reins, and provide candid feedback at the end
- **Progress tracking across practice sessions**: Voice Mode can identify improvement patterns over time ("your user segmentation has improved") — provides the kind of longitudinal coaching feedback usually reserved for expensive human coaches
