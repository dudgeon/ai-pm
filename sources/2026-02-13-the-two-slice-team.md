summary: "Dan Shipper argues Amazon's 'two-pizza rule' is now obsolete — AI has made the 'two-slice team' viable: one person running an entire software product with AI doing the coding, customer service, market research, and product thinking. Every runs four products this way, each with a single general manager; internal design/growth/marketing teams act as floating agencies that support GMs project-by-project rather than being full-time staff."

**The Two-slice Team**
*Amazon's "two-pizza rule" worked for the past twenty-four years. We need a new heuristic for the next.*

TLDR: Today we're launching a new experiment: Proof, an agent-native markdown editor that lets you collaborate on documents with multiple humans and AI agents at once. It's available now for paid Every subscribers.

For the past two decades, Amazon's "two-pizza rule" has been the gold standard for team size.

The story goes like this: At a company retreat in 2002, when Amazon managers wanted more communication between teams, Jeff Bezos said "communication is terrible!" and instituted a rule: if a team can't be fed by two pizzas, it's too big.

Twenty-four years later, two-pizza teams are now themselves too big for building software products. With the latest generation of AI coding models like Opus 4.6 and Codex 5.3, a single person—with the right workflow—can do the work that used to take a team.

I call it the two-slice team. Two slices, to feed one person. (These are New York slices that you fold in half.)

This is how we structure our product teams at Every. We have four software products, each run by a single general manager with AI doing the heavy lifting.

The two-slice team structure lets us ship faster, pivot more quickly, and maintain the entrepreneurial energy of a small startup while running a portfolio of products.

And these are real products, not just weekend vibe coding demos. For example, Monologue, our smart dictation app, is run by Naveen Naidu—a single general manager. It has thousands of active users, runs a full iOS app, and recently launched on the App Store.

AI also helps Naveen do customer service and market research, and think through business and product strategy. It's still a two-slice team.

A two-slice team works well as a starting point for software products. But as these products have grown, we've started to think more carefully about how they should scale.

**How organizations support two-slice teams**

Rather than putting more full-time employees on existing products, two-slice teams pull in help as needed from the broader organization.

To enable this, our design, growth, and marketing teams act as internal agencies that move team members across products as needed.

For example, our creative director Lucas Crespo runs a three-person team. A team member might help design a new Spiral feature one week and a Cora feature the next.

Sometimes these resources come from outside of Every too. Cora, run by Kieran Klaassen, employs a full-stack senior engineer as a contractor who works about 20 hours per week.

This kind of flexible structure is only possible because AI lets internal employees and freelancers ramp up quickly on any product without a steep learning curve.

We think it's a superior working experience for everyone involved. General managers get a lot of autonomy and credit for their product's success. Designers, engineers, and marketers get exposure to a wide portfolio of products and challenges.

In fact, I've been acting as a two-slice team myself. For the last few weeks I've been building an agent-native markdown editor called Proof.

It's a great example of what's possible with a two-slice team-size. An editor like this would have previously required a team of engineers, product managers, and designers working for several months. Instead, it took a few weeks with me doing the product design and AI doing the implementation.

Proof has started to get traction inside of Every. We use it to collaborate on the plan files generated by Claude Code before each coding session.
