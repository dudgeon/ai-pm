summary: "Lewis Kallow uses 1930s Iowa corn adoption research to argue that in an age of commoditized AI code, distribution advantage comes from understanding how trust travels through communities — specifically through 'social dandelions' (connectors who spread ideas within dense networks). Key insight: low-risk things go viral; high-risk things require social proof. The playbook: target density before distribution — find one tight community, earn their trust, let them spread it."

**AI Can Build Anything. Social Dandelions Decide What Spreads.**

By Lewis Kallow | January 15, 2026

Draws a through line from 1930s Iowa corn adoption research to today's fastest-growing AI products. When code is commoditized, distribution advantage comes from understanding how trust travels through communities.

Key sections:
- **Low risk is viral. High risk is social.**: Low-risk ideas spread via algorithms; high-risk ideas require trusted social proof from within your community
- **Density before distribution**: Don't try to reach everyone — find one tight community, earn trust, let them carry it
- **Which community should you target?**: Find the one where your product solves the sharpest pain
- **Who do you approach?**: "Social dandelions" — connectors who spread to many others in the network
- **How do you convince them?**: Give them the language and social proof they need to advocate on your behalf
- **From code to community**: In the AI era, understanding community trust dynamics may be the last defensible competitive edge
