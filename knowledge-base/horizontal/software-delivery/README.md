# Horizontal: Software Delivery Methodologies

Emerging methodologies for how software gets built in an AI-native world — compound engineering, spec-driven development, and other approaches that reshape the relationship between PMs, engineers, and AI agents during delivery.

## Scope

- Named delivery methodologies (compound engineering, spec-driven development, vibe coding, etc.)
- How these methodologies interact with and reshape the product lifecycle
- PM's role within each methodology — what changes, what stays
- Tradeoffs between methodologies (when to use which)
- How delivery methodology choice affects upstream (shaping, speccing) and downstream (release, measurement) phases

## What Belongs Here

An entry belongs in Software Delivery when it's:
- About *how software gets delivered* as a methodology or system (not a single technique)
- Specific enough to study as a named approach with proponents, tradeoffs, and contexts
- Relevant to PMs because it changes what they need to provide, review, or manage

Entries that are individual techniques *within* a methodology (e.g., a specific prompting pattern used during spec-driven development) may be better suited for [Practices](../practices/) with a cross-reference back here.

## Relationship to the Product Lifecycle

Software delivery methodologies are **not a lifecycle phase** — they're an operating model that overlays multiple phases (primarily Shape, Build, and Release). Entries here will frequently cross-reference lifecycle phase entries and vice versa. An insight about how spec-driven development changes PRD writing would live in `product-lifecycle/build/` but reference the methodology entry here.

## Emerging Topics

- Compound engineering — human-agent collaborative delivery
- Spec-driven development — specification as the primary artifact AI agents execute against
- Vibe coding — rapid prototyping via conversational AI interaction
- Agent-native engineering — restructuring engineering workflows around AI agents as first-class participants
