# Horizontal: Practices

Atomic, portable techniques that cut across the product lifecycle — prompting patterns, writing workflows, context engineering, workflow design. These are individual methods you can apply regardless of what lifecycle phase you're in.

## Scope

- Named techniques and patterns for working with AI tools
- Prompting strategies applicable across domains
- Human-AI collaboration patterns (role delineation, feedback loops)
- Workflow design for AI-augmented work

## What Belongs Here

An entry belongs in Practices when it's:
- A single, discrete technique (not a domain of study)
- Applicable across 3+ lifecycle phases
- Useful independent of organizational context (unlike AI Adoption)
- Not specific to a delivery methodology, agent management, or knowledge management workflow

## Relationship to Other Horizontal Domains

Practices are the atomic building blocks. The other horizontal domains (Software Delivery, Agent Lifecycle, Knowledge Management) are deeper areas of study that may *contain* or *reference* individual practices. A prompting pattern extracted from an agent onboarding workflow might live here if it's broadly portable, or in Agent Lifecycle if it's specific to that context.
