# Horizontal: Knowledge Management

How to feed, curate, and access private and public context that is shared by both humans and agents. As AI agents become participants in knowledge work, the systems for organizing, surfacing, and maintaining knowledge need to serve both human retrieval and agent consumption — and the PM is often the person responsible for making this work.

## Scope

- Context engineering — structuring knowledge so agents can consume it effectively
- Knowledge curation — what to capture, what to prune, how to maintain quality
- Access patterns — how humans and agents retrieve and use shared knowledge differently
- Private vs. public context — managing what agents should and shouldn't know
- Knowledge as product — treating internal knowledge bases as products with users (both human and agent)
- Organizational knowledge strategy — how teams build and maintain shared context

## What Belongs Here

An entry belongs in Knowledge Management when it's:
- About *systems and strategies* for managing knowledge (not a single context-loading technique)
- Relevant to both human and agent consumers of knowledge
- About the ongoing curation and maintenance of knowledge, not just initial capture
- Applicable across lifecycle phases and team contexts

Individual techniques for loading context into a specific AI tool belong in [Practices](../practices/) (e.g., "Deliberate Context Selection" is already there). Knowledge Management is about the broader system those techniques operate within.

## Relationship to the Product Lifecycle

Knowledge management enables every lifecycle phase but isn't a phase itself:
- **Discover**: Knowledge bases inform problem identification and market understanding
- **Frame**: Historical context and institutional knowledge shape business cases
- **Shape**: Past decisions, user research archives, and design systems inform solution design
- **Build**: Specs, context files, and shared documentation enable AI-assisted development
- **Release**: Release knowledge, runbooks, and institutional memory support deployment
- **Measure**: Learnings feed back into the knowledge base, closing the loop

## Emerging Topics

- Context engineering for AI agents (CLAUDE.md files, system prompts, knowledge loading)
- Human-agent shared knowledge formats and standards
- Knowledge maintenance as a PM responsibility
- Private context management and PII-aware knowledge systems
- Knowledge-as-product thinking for internal tools
- The feedback loop: agent outputs enriching the knowledge base
