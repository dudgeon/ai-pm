## Horizontal Domains

Lifecycle-agnostic AI PM skills and knowledge areas, organized by delivery mechanism with increasing capability and autonomy. See [taxonomy](../meta/taxonomy.md#horizontal-domains) for classification rules.

### [Prompting](horizontal/prompting/) — Portable Techniques

Portable techniques for crafting effective instructions — works in any chat window. Prompting patterns, meta-skill patterns, writing workflows, role delineation.

- [Be 100x More Specific](horizontal/prompting/be-100x-more-specific.md) — Forces AI past vague principles into concrete, actionable standards
- [My Job Your Job Role Delineation](horizontal/prompting/my-job-your-job-role-delineation.md) — Explicit human/AI responsibility partitioning
- [AI as Writing Coach](horizontal/prompting/ai-as-writing-coach.md) — Structured workflow: thesis validation → blind spots → restructuring
- [LLMs Generate, Not Retrieve](horizontal/prompting/llms-generate-not-retrieve.md) — Root cause mental model: LLMs produce statistically plausible text, not retrieved text; explains hallucinated quotes, fabricated citations, confident errors

### [Context & Knowledge Management](horizontal/context/) — Knowledge Infrastructure

Making non-code knowledge discoverable and usable to agents and their human coworkers — context graphs, agent-oriented knowledge management, progressive disclosure.

- [Deliberate Context Selection](horizontal/context/deliberate-context-selection.md) — Hand-picking files for LLM context vs. relying on automatic context
- [Sync the People — AI Disruption Profile](horizontal/context/sync-the-people-ai-disruption.md) — Human coordination and alignment; least disrupted PM job (🤖), a durable competitive advantage
- [Three-Layer Context Disclosure](horizontal/context/three-layer-context-disclosure.md) — Index → summary → full content: the converging pattern for efficient agent retrieval (~10x token savings)
- [Filesystem as Retrieval Architecture](horizontal/context/filesystem-as-retrieval-architecture.md) — Directory hierarchy as index, frontmatter as metadata, git as temporal layer — a legitimate retrieval system, not a stopgap
- [Repositories as Context Boundaries](horizontal/context/repositories-as-context-boundaries.md) — Repos shift from code isolation to context containers; git subtree/submodules as cross-repo context distribution; agents absorb submodule ceremony
- [Agent-Self-Managed Progressive Disclosure](horizontal/context/agent-self-managed-progressive-disclosure.md) — Agents actively reorganize their own memory filesystem: filetree as navigation signal, frontmatter as preview, system/ for always-loaded; dynamic not static disclosure

### [Templated AI Runtimes](horizontal/runtimes/) — Packaged AI Tools

Packaged, shareable, non-agentic AI tools (Custom GPTs, Google Gems, Claude Projects). Building, distributing, and managing templated AI runtimes for teams and organizations.

*No entries yet.*

### [Agents](horizontal/agents/) — Building & Managing Knowledge Agents

Building and managing knowledge agents — lifecycle management, rules, skills, templates, tools, workflows. How PMs select, onboard, train, and performance-manage AI agents.

#### [System Design](horizontal/agents/system-design/) — Agent System Design

**[Instruction Design](horizontal/agents/system-design/instruction-design/)** — CLAUDE.md, agents.md & behavioral configuration
- [Structured Context Loading](horizontal/agents/system-design/instruction-design/structured-context-loading.md) — Purpose-built files loaded before each interaction to align agent behavior

- [Git-Versioned Agent Memory](horizontal/agents/system-design/architecture/git-versioned-agent-memory.md) — Every memory change is a commit with message; audit trail, rollback, temporal narrative of agent learning; extends filesystem-as-retrieval with a temporal layer
- [Concurrent Agent Memory via Git Worktrees](horizontal/agents/system-design/architecture/concurrent-agent-memory-via-worktrees.md) — Multiple subagents write to shared memory simultaneously via isolated git worktrees; enables memory swarms for initialization and parallel learning

#### [Harnesses](horizontal/agents/harnesses/) — Platform-Specific Knowledge

- [Cursor: Structured AI Development](horizontal/agents/harnesses/cursor-structured-ai-development.md) — Three-file rule system, @-includes, MCP config, and Repo Prompt for structured workflows in Cursor

#### [Managing Agents](horizontal/agents/managing-agents/) — The Human-Agent Management Relationship

The practice of managing AI agents as autonomous participants. Distinct from system design (building agents) and harnesses (platforms) — this is about the *relationship* between human and agent.

**Thesis**: [Talent-to-Direction Scarcity Shift](horizontal/agents/managing-agents/talent-to-direction-scarcity-shift.md) — AI inverts traditional scarcity: talent is abundant, knowing what to ask for is the bottleneck

**Delegation Craft**:
- [Delegation Documentation as Agent Prompts](horizontal/agents/managing-agents/delegation/delegation-documentation-as-prompts.md) — Every field's delegation docs (PRDs, shot lists, Five Paragraph Orders) are AI prompts; common elements pattern

**Agent Selection & Onboarding**:
- [Model Fit for Qualitative Analysis Tasks](horizontal/agents/managing-agents/selection/model-fit-for-qualitative-analysis.md) — Claude (depth/breadth), Gemini (evidenced themes), ChatGPT (stakeholder framing) as distinct strengths for analysis work; technique quality matters more than model choice

## AI Adoption & Change Management

- [Reverse Engineer Judgment Into AI](ai-adoption/reverse-engineer-judgment-into-ai.md) — Have AI discover your implicit criteria, encode into reusable evaluator
- [Scale Manager Expertise With AI](ai-adoption/scale-manager-expertise-with-ai.md) — Automate "0-to-60%" feedback so managers focus on high-leverage work
- [AI Disrupts Strategic PM Skills Most](ai-adoption/ai-disrupts-strategic-pm-skills-most.md) — Counterintuitively, AI most disrupts high-level strategic PM skills, not soft skills
- [Data Silos Block Enterprise Agent Adoption](ai-adoption/data-silos-block-agent-adoption.md) — Enterprise data fragmented across SaaS tools is the primary barrier to agent rollout, not model capability
- [Tool Identity as Adoption Gate](ai-adoption/tool-identity-as-adoption-gate.md) — When a capable AI tool has narrow adoption, the bottleneck may be naming/branding/positioning, not capability
- [Retrieval Infrastructure Graduation](ai-adoption/retrieval-infrastructure-graduation.md) — Tiered path from filesystem-only → semantic search → knowledge graph, with graduation criteria for each transition
- [Raise the Floor vs Raise the Ceiling](ai-adoption/raise-the-floor-vs-raise-the-ceiling.md) — Two axes of AI adoption: floor (Gems, packaged runtimes for everyone) vs ceiling (agentic methods for power users); effective change management sequences and balances both

## Adjacent Disciplines

How AI transforms the disciplines of PMs' close collaborators (engineering, design, analytics) — and what their shifting AI adoption means for product leadership. In many non-AI-native orgs, engineering leads product in agentic adoption; PMs are likely to lead design and analytics.

- [Spec-Driven Development](adjacent-disciplines/spec-driven-development.md) — Software ships as specs + tests with zero code; works for stable utilities, breaks for anything needing performance, debugging, community, or security patching
